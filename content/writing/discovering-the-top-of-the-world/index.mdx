excerpt: A family friendly walk along The Top Of The World.
---

We discovered while discovering ‘The Top Of The World’ that this walk was one of the most accessible we have undertaken around Malta with a young child and a toddler so far. There are a couple of hair-raising bits (take a firm grasp of little hands for “Ooh, look how high we are!”) and a steep incline (be ready for “Carry me!”), but otherwise, the kids could roam freely. While a wheelchair might have problems along one portion of the path, and the steep incline will need to be tackled slowly, I think older and less able persons would still be able to complete it without too much difficulty.

We went for this particular walk on a fine Maltese Winter’s day in February while the sun was shining and the sky was blue. But, let’s start at the beginning of how we got to ‘The Top Of The World’ in the first place. 
The route to a local supermarket runs along the top of a very deep valley near one of the larger villages of Malta. Every shopping trip would result in a  “There has to be some way of getting down!” from either my husband Carl or myself. From every direction, trying to get to the bottom looked similar to jumping off the nearest big city skyscraper without a parachute. Failing to inspire any divine inspiration, I used common sense instead and inquired with some of my work colleagues.

“It’s near to Mosta, and it’s a valley. We know there must be a way down, but we don’t know how to get down, and we don’t know what it’s called, so we can’t look it up to see how we get down.” I explained, which got an answer and some directions. I passed these directions along to my husband, and the next day, we were all free off we went.

So! Directions given? Check! Phone set to direct us? Check! (Remember this part for later and think of the game ‘Chinese Whispers’…) Drinks and snacks? Check! Nappies and wet wipes for Taran? Check! Spare clothing for whatever minor disaster may happen? Check! “Isla did a pee-pee?” No! “Go and pee-pee.”, “I don’t need to pee-pee!”, “Go! Pee-pee!”. Daughter did a pee-pee? Check! Faces cleaned? Check! Four people strapped into a car? Check! Everything previously checked is now in the car with four people strapped into the car? Check! Okay then, let’s go!

As usual, Carl drove. We are into the stereotypical man and his wife roles Carl drives because, while having been perfectly comfortable with driving in England as soon as I hit legal age, I fear actually driving in Malta. This fear is reaching phobia level. I acknowledge the need for something to be done about it, but my husband always drives for the moment. I, however, always back seat drive, so we get there safely, although not necessarily the best of friends!

I watched the red arrow on the mobile and directed right or left until we got to ‘You are here.’ Carl realised immediately ‘You are here.’ was not where we had intended to be. However, two kids were in the back of the car, letting it be known they thought they had been there long enough, prompting the decision that we might as well look since we were there anyway.

As it turns out, it was quite a lovely mistake. We really went to the ‘top of the world’. Okay, well, this is Malta, a small island at sea level, so the ‘top of the world’ turned out to be a few extra metres above sea level. Still, you could see for many miles across the landscape.

The walk began on an almost straight and tarmacked road – such luxury! No rocks to climb. No cracks to jump. No death-defying sheer drop on one side! Malta! What has happened? Without death or severe dismemberment to make the walk interesting, Isla tugs at me. “It’s boring, Mummy! Let’s go to the swings and slides!” 
Luckily, right then, there were some interesting birds! Suddenly the walk became a bit more exciting. Big birds temporarily trumped swings and slides. We photographed the birds, we viewed, we admired, and we told the kids they were ‘girl peacocks’, which were called peahens. In fact, I suspect we might have lied a bit because they didn’t look the pictures of peahens I googled later. What they were, still remains a mystery.

A little bit further along, two men were building something just below the road – my kids and one of the men had a friendly wave across the distance. A wave or a hello from a stranger always makes Isla’s day.

On most outings, parents are required to be all-knowing about various flora and fauna – this trip was no exception. Any close-up flower or insect photographs I take are always at the end of a “What’s that, Mummy?” conversation.  My reply is usually, “We will look it up later”. I think I now know the names of more flowers in Malta than I ever knew in England.

This was a beautiful tree with every branch covered in pretty white flowers, which we believe might be an almond tree.

As we continued walking, the view ahead showed the typical Maltese landscape during Winter; blues, greens and white. Malta’s greenest season is Winter, when the Mediterranean sun is less scorching. The smooth, dark greens of the growing plants are vivid in contrast to the bleached and pock-marked rock they nestle into. Add in a topping of blue sky and outline everything with blue from the Mediterranean water, and this is Malta. 

The road bends round to the left at the end, and there is a sheer drop ahead. Ah, there we are! What’s a Maltese hike without the imminent threat of death by means of a sharp drop? A few public benches are set out to admire the beautiful view from a seated position, one of the benches was in a precarious position and without safety features of any kind, it seemed designed for the contemplation of life and death. Guess which of the benches the kids wanted to sit on? 
A small platform with a rusty looking wire for one’s personal safety – let’s ignore the gaping holes at the bottom - jutted out a little further over the drop, thus allowing one to risk life and limb for a better view or a beautiful panoramic photograph like this one.

One or both of us held the kids in a death grip while we admired and photographed. My husband even braved the ‘contemplation of life’ bench and pretended relaxation for a photo there as well. The only minus point was some rubbish which had gathered around the benches. Why can’t people take their trash away with them?!

We turned left onto a slightly rougher track with a death-defying drop on the right side; however, this was mitigated by a wall above four-year-old child height, while on the left side, there was a steep rocky, yet flora-covered hill. We felt safe enough at this point to let the kids run around freely, and all along the walk, other families were doing the same. It wasn’t a busy place, but it wasn’t deserted either.

The surprise at the end of the track is a beautiful picnic area called Ghal Ghar, accessible from the opposite direction by car too. There are benches and tables to eat or read whilst overlooking the valley, and there were many solo people with a good book. We took a slight detour around the benches, established a death grip on both kids, stood in front of a terrifying drop, and looked out over the valley towards the Victoria Lines. The Victoria Lines are a set of fortifications from Malta’s history and are a separate story.

The walk along ‘The Top Of The World’ is a walk of many parts, with each one being completely different from the previous one: the panoramic view, the picnic/reading area, the historical view, the poignant view, the religious view and the quaint view. Next was the poignant view. There at the roadside was a small planted flower tribute to someone’s dead son. February is one of Malta’s ‘growing’ months, and it was in full bloom: both beautiful and touching. 

The religious view came soon after and was worth the walk all by itself. A church for tiny people! Okay, so maybe not. Malta is a Roman Catholic Island and very religious. It has many churches all vying with each other in size and decoration. This stands out as Malta’s smallest church. It is an incredible replica of the much larger Gharghur church, complete with doors and bells. The whole thing is created from stones, pebbles and shells. It is definitely something to see and is far more than this photo shows!

After the mini-church, there is a short stretch of road followed by a steep climb up into Gharghur villager itself. This was the cue for a slurry of complaints from short legs! My two-year-old son was passed between us depending on who’s arms were most tired. At the ripe old age of four, Isla was a big girl and had to walk it – oh, the unfairness! Suddenly being a ‘big girl’ wasn’t such a good thing! It wasn’t so far, but I think any ‘silver’ ramblers would need to take it slowly and rest often. Obviously, what goes up must come down and down we went towards the car and the end of this walk around ‘The Top Of The World’.
