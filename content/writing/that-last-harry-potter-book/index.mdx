excerpt: Remembering the time I got my hands on that last Harry Potter book. 
---

Some books hit the world, full-on, like a freight train. Not many, but some. 
Usually, these are religious texts, but sometimes, every now and again, they are something else. Think Lord of the Rings, even those who have never read the series know of it, have some idea what it’s about. Oliver, Pride and Prejudice and Wuthering Heights have travelled down through the ages, and they are known even if they have never been read. The Romanians invariably have to manage those vampire jokes thanks to the global impact of Dracula more than a hundred years after it was written. Dracula spawned Twilight, and now there is a generation of young girls dreaming of handsome vampires. Nurses at the hospital where I gave birth to my son were preparing for a Shades of Grey baby boom later in the year - mainly by all trying to book vacation leave simultaneously. Then, there was Harry Potter.

I can’t say I really understood the Twilight and Shades of Grey phenomena. I apologise to the many fans of these books, but I found the main characters in both of these series to be irritatingly dull and weak. But when it comes to Harry Potter, I did and do follow the crowd - I loved it! 

I came to Harry Potter a little behind everyone else, I think, at around book three. I knew of it, but, foolish me, I dismissed it because it was labelled a children’s book. Then, the first movie had just come out. It was a great hit, but it was a kids movie, and so I bypassed it at the cinema - I’m not going to see a kids movie!  Then it appeared on DVD, and again, I continuously walked past it on the shelf. A work colleague told me to buy it. ‘It’s great!’ she said. I continued to bypass it. Eventually, after a run of absolutely terrible – really terrible - movie purchases down the line, I did. 

The magical world of Harry Potter dazzled, childhood daydreams parcelled into a movie.  Doesn’t every kid wish they could do magic, like, real magic? I know I did. Shh! Secretly, I still do! 

On the next trip to the supermarket, I went past the DVD’s and hit the book section. I bought the first three books, they were a little slim, which was a disappointment admittedly, and I read them quickly. 

I always like to read books twice. The first time very quickly to find out what happens at the end of the story. Impatient? Me? Teehee! Then, I read my book immediately again at a much slower pace but generally more focussed and intense - unless it’s really, really bad, of course. 
The Harry Potter books, however, did not disappoint.  The movie was very good, the books were even better.

I waited for the next book, and the next, and then the next. Discussions abound. What was Harry’s future? How would it all end? Was Snape really the arch-villain? What secrets was Dumbledore keeping? Would Malfoy get his comeuppance? Would house-elves get equal rights? Who would Harry Potter end up with romantically took numerous discussions, often in-depth, I got it wrong. I really thought Hermione would be the girlfriend, but then Ron, as it was pointed out, would have been left without anyone.

Then… it happened… the seventh and final book was published! That last Harry Potter book. My husband had pre-ordered it. He woke me up in the morning with a drink and a brand new hardback copy of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Opening my brand new copy of the final Harry Potter book, I turned to the first page and began to read. 

My husband brought me breakfast in bed. I ate it. I read. My husband brought me lunch, still in bed. I ate it. I read. My husband brought me my favourite chocolate. I think I got some on the bed covers. I didn’t really care. I read. My husband brought me dinner. I read. My husband came to sleep. I read. I finished the book at about 4 am. I fell asleep with a head full of magic. I hadn’t left the bedroom. My husband earned himself lots of brownie points on that day!

Now for the Harry Potter books in a sentence. Harry Potter is a wizard, he goes to school, and a bad wizard tries to kill him. 

The world of magic JK Rowling created to run alongside the real world in the books is genius. The characters are great, although I think the supporting characters, good and bad, are more interesting than the main ones. I find this happens so often…

In the movies, everything is magical. Whoever thought up the magical fights was genius. The supporting actors dominate. But, before anyone thinks poorly of the main three actors, let me be fair about this. The Harry Potter movies are filled – like filled - with the who’s who of British acting talent. The mightiest actors and actresses from the length and breadth of Britain are in these movies with decades of experience between them. Young children with little to no acting experience never stood a chance against that kind of talent.

Not long ago, as an idea for another post, I asked the same question far and wide. “Choose a favourite book and tell me why.” Young, old and in-between counted the Harry Potter series as their favourite books, while those who didn’t followed up another book with “or the Harry Potter books“. A young boy on his way to school has become a phenomenon.
