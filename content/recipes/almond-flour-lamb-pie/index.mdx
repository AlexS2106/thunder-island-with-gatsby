    - When the ghee is hot, brown the lamb on all sides, about 1 minute each side.

    - Remove the pan from the heat and wait 5 minutes until it cools a little.

    - Leave the rest of the cooking juices in the slow cooker on low.

    - Cut the pastry into quarters for transfering to the dish.
    - Transfer the pastry pieces across to cover the lamb until all the pastry is used and the pie is completely covered.

This lamb pie is another deceptively simple recipe. In fact, the longest time I was stuck at the kitchen counter was when I was cutting up the slow-cooked lamb to pop it into the pie. 

It was only a few weeks ago, I posted a Almond Flour Beef and Onion Pie. This recipe also happened to be low in net carbs as well. When I first made said pie, it turned out so well we’ve made it several times since. But, I didn’t stop there and experimented with getting the carbs even lower! My hubby, Carl, is a pie lover. Well, he’s a Leeds man. Leeds men just love their pies – and their super-hot curries.  But, back to pies. He has been my pie tester. I think he has been in heaven every dinner time. Pies that help him lose weight! Yeah!
Lamb Just Tastes Good

This pie is lamb this time because lamb just tastes good, and not every pie should be beef. (I actually tried to think of a really good keto reason to use lamb right then and came up empty.) Not that lamb isn’t an excellent keto meat, it is, but I used it because it tastes great. There is no wonderous higher reason behind it. 

This recipe just turned out straight-up delicious. Well, it had lamb, and it’s a pie. It’s hard to go wrong with such a tasty combo. But, even so, it is super delicious. So, here you are. If you, like Carl, are lamenting your loss of tasty pie for dinner while dieting, then lament no more. Here comes another pie in the low carb pie range to warm your tastebuds. So, you can get set to experience those incredible comfort foods once again.
