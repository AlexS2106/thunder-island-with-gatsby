excerpt: Cauliflower replaces potatoes for the topping, while the centre is mostly meat with a few select, low carb veggies. A variety of herbs make it great tasting.

### Instructions

#### Preparation
  - Finely chop the fennel
  - Chop the broccoli.
  - Peel, top and tail, and chop the courgette.
  - Chop the cauliflower.
  - Crush the garlic cloves.

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Pre-heat a fan-assisted oven to 200 deg C (400 deg F).
    - Put a saucepan of water on the hob to boil.
  - **Step 2**
    - When the water boils, add the broccoli florets.
    - Cook for about 10 mins, till soft.
  - **Step 3**
    - While the broccoli is cooking, melt the duck fat in a frying pan over a medium-high heat. (I use number 7.)
    - Add the fennel to the frying pan and fry till soft, about 5-10 mins.
    - Add the ground lamb to the frying pan and fry until browned.
  - **Step 4**
    - When the broccoli is soft, use a slotted spoon and remove the broccoli florets.
    - Add the broccoli to the frying pan with the fennel and mince along with the courgette.  
    - Immediately add the cauliflower to boil for about 15 mins, until soft.
  - **Step 5**

  - **Step 6**
    - Pour the meat from the frying pan into a 23cm x 23cm (9inch by 9inch) casserole dish. 
    - Smooth the meat into one even layer.
  - **Step 7**
    - When the cauliflower is soft, our out the water and add the cauliflower back into the saucepan onto the heat stirring often to evaporate any excess water. Be careful the cauliflower does not burn. 
    - Remove from the heat after a minute or sooner.
    - Allow the cauliflower to cool a little before pouring it into a food processor. 
    - Add the butter, salt, pepper and coconut cream to the processor. 
    - Blitz everything until smooth.
    - Pour the cauliflower mix on top of the mince and use a spoon or spatula to smooth into one layer covering the mince.
  - **Step 8**
    - Place the casserole dish in the centre of the oven for 20 – 25 mins.
  - **Step 9**
    - If you want to add cheese, sprinkle it over the cauliflower mash about 10 mins from the end.
    - Serve.

Paleo Butternut Squash and Carrot Soup came into existence when the case of the ‘sniffles’ got passed around the family.  The tiny culprits who brought the plague home were completely unbothered by it - the more senior members suffered yet soldiered bravely on… Yeah, right :P  
 
It’s written in stone somewhere in Britain, and probably in other countries too, that a cold requires either stew or soup. I didn’t have many recipes for stews or soups, so an excellent excuse to create something new presented itself.  I also had a ready-to-hand group of captives to experiment on. Mwa-ha-ha! 

I decided on soup for no particular reason that I can recall and thought the ingredients through very carefully.  I did this by opening the fridge door and seeing what was there. Cue a butternut squash lurking around in the bottom of my fridge.  It had been lurking for two weeks, waiting to become… something, and if it lurked much longer, it would have the ignominy of becoming a fungus.  Such a terrible end to the life of one little butternut squash! I could and would remedy the sad situation forthwith! 

Decision made! Butternuts squash soup it would be! I rescued the butternut squash from the fridge and realised I had lurking carrots as well.  How fortuitous!  Butternut Squash and Carrot Soup – let’s go!

A poorly persons’ soup needs to be warm, comforting and filling while imparting an illness fighting boost to one’s body - foods like lemon, honey, and ginger.  Do they work?  I’m not really sure, but they taste nice, so it’s a great distraction from the misery.

So, one by one… Lemon. Lemon soup? Err… no! Ditch the lemon.
Honey? Butternut squash carries a fair few carbs and is sweet enough without adding honey. Save the honey and use it for a hot drink along with the previously ditched lemons.

Ginger? Ginger sounds nice. I add it.  My fresh ginger turned out to be not so fresh. It, too, had lurked in the fridge and had lurked into something unnameable.  Bet everyone is thinking bad thoughts about the state of my fridge.  Let me add a note in my defence, I was the first person the kids passed the cold along to, and I hadn’t felt like doing much either!  With my domesticity defended, let me return to the not-too-fresh-ginger. I threw it into the bin.  

With my mind set on fresh ginger, I braved the afternoon heat of a Maltese Summer to go get some that was a tad fresher.

A fifteen-minute walk away, I reached the delicious environment of the air-conditioned local supermarket whilst truly pondering the absolute necessity of fresh ginger when I had some perfectly fine dried stuff at home already.  

The supermarket employee at the fruit and veg section was a lovely man with the world’s worst hairstyle or, perhaps, I am just too old now to appreciate “the man bun” – probably the latter. Keeping my hairstyle opinions to myself, I chose a nice knobbly bit of ginger, and the said young man and I discussed the healing qualities of ginger. He swore by its healing properties, along with turmeric and garlic.  I took his advice and bought some turmeric and garlic as well.

Back at home and rather sweaty, I laid out my ingredients. I decided to add an apple for a bit of extra oompf! An apple a day keeps the doctor away, so they say. I am not so sure it does, but apples do help add flavour. More flavour is always a good thing.

Finally, I needed more aromatics. Cue fennel as my go-to aromatic rather than onion for tummy health reasons. If you have bloating or digestive issues, try dropping out onions for a week or two and see if it helps, you might be surprised.  I also added in nutmeg and cinnamon. These two spices always make me think of warmth and comfort, even just their names are soft and warm. 

Soup ingredients all sorted? Check! Everything cooked up? Check!  Lastly is the stock for liquidity and coconut cream for creaminess.
Force this experimental soup into anyone with a handkerchief and watch for the reactions.

I, and my soup, got a big thumbs up. 

We did all agree that if you add two more cups of stock to this, it will taste just as good while serving another person or two.  However, I like the smooth thickness of the recipe exactly as it is, so I have never altered the recipe.  But, if you have extra to feed or want to save a few more pennies, add in the extra stock.

As for any healing properties this soup may have, well, everyone did recover from their colds - eventually.
