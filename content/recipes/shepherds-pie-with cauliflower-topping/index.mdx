### Instructions

#### Preparation
  - Finely chop the fennel
  - Chop the broccoli.
  - Peel, top and tail, and chop the courgette.
  - Chop the cauliflower.
  - Crush the garlic cloves.

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Pre-heat a fan-assisted oven to 200 deg C (400 deg F).
    - Put a saucepan of water on the hob to boil.
  - **Step 2**
    - When the water boils, add the broccoli florets.
    - Cook for about 10 mins, till soft.
  - **Step 3**
    - While the broccoli is cooking, melt the duck fat in a frying pan over medium-high heat. (I use number 7.)
    - Add the fennel to the frying pan and fry till soft, about 5-10 mins.
    - Add the ground lamb to the frying pan and fry until browned.
  - **Step 4**
    - When the broccoli is soft, use a slotted spoon and remove the broccoli florets.
    - Add the broccoli to the frying pan with the fennel and mince along with the courgette.  
    - Immediately add the cauliflower to boil for about 15 mins, until soft.
  - **Step 5**
    -  Add the coconut flour to the frying pan and stir in.
    - Add all the remaining ingredients for the meat, the parsley, rosemary, thyme, salt, black pepper, white vinegar, garlic cloves, tomato puree and chicken stock and stir in.
  - **Step 6**
    - Pour the meat from the frying pan into a 23cm x 23cm (9inch by 9inch) casserole dish. 
    - Smooth the meat into one even layer.
  - **Step 7**
    - When the cauliflower is soft, our out the water and add the cauliflower back into the saucepan onto the heat; stir often to evaporate any excess water. Be careful that the cauliflower does not burn. 
    - Remove from the heat after a minute or sooner.
    - Allow the cauliflower to cool slightly before pouring it into a food processor. 
    - Add the butter, salt, pepper and coconut cream to the processor. 
    - Blitz everything until smooth.
    - Pour the cauliflower mix on top of the mince and use a spoon or spatula to smooth into one layer covering the mince.
  - **Step 8**
    - Place the casserole dish in the centre of the oven for 20 â€“ 25 mins.
  - **Step 9**
    - If you want to add cheese, sprinkle it over the cauliflower mash about 10 mins from the end.
    - Serve.
