<Ingredients>

### Ingredients

- 2 medium eggs
- 2 medium rashers bacon
- ½ tbsp ghee or lard

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Melt the ghee in a medium frying pan at medium heat. (I use number 5.)
  - **Step 2**
    - When the ghee is heated, crack the eggs one at a time into separate areas of the pan, don't worry if the whites mix together.
    - Place a cover over the frying pan. Use a saucepan lid if your frying pan doesn't have one. The important thing is to keep the air over the top of the eggs heated. 
    - Set a timer for 5 minutes.
  - **Step 3**
    - Place the bacon onto a microwaveable plate and microwave to desired 'doneness'. 
  - **Step 4**
    - When the timer pings, check the eggs. They should be cooked with soft liquid yolks. If not, leave them another minute and recheck.
  - **Step 5**
    - Serve everything together on the plate.

Eggs And Bacon! It's a great recipe, but why is she posting a recipe for eggs and bacon?

Well, I have my reasons. 

There are those of us in the human population (I know because I used to be one) who have previously made this most classic of breakfasts by the swift and happy means of ditching some refined oil into a small pan. Said ditching would be followed up with dropping in any old egg  – ( oops, how did that shell get in there?) – we had bought in the local shop. This highly unfortunate egg would be liberally splashed with the unhealthy oil until things looked sunny - unless we had broken the yolk. In which case, we ate the egg anyway and hoped to do better next time. 

Now! After many years of this tried and tested method - here comes the new, healthy and substantially more frugal version step by step! 

The first miracle of this new method? Well, as it turns out, it's a pan lid. Yep, who knew! 

Since most frying pans are adopted into one's home without a lid, it is often necessary to borrow from elsewhere and adapt. I steal pan lids from the sauce pots; the lid tends to overflow the frying pan, but it does the job nicely.


What is the perfect ratio of eggs and bacon? After much consideration and experimentation on one's tummy, I decided on two of each - two eggs, two bacon. Filling enough, but not too much. After all, camping out on the sofa with a rounded and groaning belly to watch the latest series is for dinner time; at breakfast, we still have to get stuff done for the day.

Also, by happy coincidence, two eggs are just the right size to sit side by side and fill a medium-size frying pan.

Now, let's turn to... Bacon in the Microwave? I know. I bet some of you are horrified! But, it makes for infinitely better-tasting bacon - really! Lay the fatty edge of the bacon on the outside of the plate. Within two to three minutes, there's bacon cooked in its own delicious juices with crispy edges of yummy fat.

As to the eggs, free-range eggs are always best. Crack a free-range egg in one bowl and crack a caged egg in the other, and the difference stares you in the face. But, I know getting your hands on free-range eggs is not always possible, so I will never say you must have free-range eggs because not everyone can get them. Sometimes, we don't have the option to be choosy. But, if you can be picky, remember healthy hens, healthy eggs, healthy you!
