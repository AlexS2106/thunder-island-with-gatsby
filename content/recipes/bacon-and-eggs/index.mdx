excerpt: Eggs and bacon - possibly the most perfect of all breakfast recipes.
---

<Ingredients>

### Ingredients

- 2 medium eggs
- 2 medium rashers bacon
- ½ tbsp ghee or lard

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Melt the ghee in a medium frying pan at a medium heat. (I use number 5.)
  - **Step 2**
    - When the ghee is heated, crack the eggs one at a time into separate areas of the pan, don't worry if the whites mix together.
    - Place a cover over the frying pan – you can balance the lid from a saucepan on top if your frying pan doesn't have one. The important thing is to keep the air over the top of the eggs heated. 
    - Set a timer for 5 minutes.
  - **Step 3**
    - Place the bacon onto a microwaveable plate and microwave to desired 'doneness'. 
  - **Step 4**
    - When the timer pings, check the eggs. They should be nicely cooked, with soft liquid yolks. If not, leave them another minute and recheck.
  - **Step 5**
    - Serve everything together on the plate.

Eggs and bacon! Why is she posting a recipe for eggs and bacon? You are asking.

Well, my reason is this.  There are those, and I used to be one, who have previously made this classic breakfast by the swift and happy means of ditching a ton of refined oil into a small pan. Follow this up with any old egg – how did that shell get in there? – which was then liberally splashed with the unhealthy oil until things looked sunny. After many years of this tried and tested method, here comes the new, healthy and substantially more frugal version.

The miracle of this new method? As it turns out, it’s a pan lid. Since most frying pans are adopted into one’s home without a lid. It is often necessary to borrow from elsewhere and adapt.  I steal a pan lid from one of my sauce pots. The lid tends to overflow the frying pan, but it gets the job done nicely.


What is the perfect ratio of eggs and bacon? After much consideration and experimentation on one’s tummy, I decided on two of each.  This proves filling enough, but not too much.  After all, we still have to get stuff done for the day.  Camping out on the sofa with a nicely stuffed belly to watch the latest series is for dinner, which is still hours away.

Also, two eggs are just the right size to fill a medium-size frying pan.

Now, let's turn to... Bacon in the Microwave?

I know I know some of you are horrified!  But, it’s how I prefer my bacon to be cooked.  Frying it takes too much time and needs watching.  Who so ever has time to get the grill warmed up in the morning? And what are you doing that I am not?  Microwaving bacon, however, is quick, and you can leave it to go off and do whatever else needs doing. and… And this is a big and! It makes crispy edges! I prefer the exterior fatty edge of my bacon to be crispy. The still white rubbery stuff is a bit off-putting for me.  Microwaving, however, is the only guaranteed crispy edge method of cooking bacon.

As to the eggs, free-range eggs are always best. But, I do know getting your hands on free-range eggs is not always a possibility, so I will never say you must have free range eggs because not everyone can get them. Sometimes, we don’t have the options to be choosy. 

For those who can be choosy, what I will say is compare the two. Crack an egg from a free-range hen into one bowl, crack an egg from a caged hen into another bowl and compare the two. The difference is right there in front of your eyes. Anyone who now says hens don’t know or care if they are in cages ain’t looking at the reality of things.  Now consider this. If the hens feel so much better being free-range, it shows in the colour of their eggs. What other great nutrients are going into the eggs that aren’t going into them when caged? Healthy hens, healthy eggs, healthy you! Choose free-range! It’s another winning slogan – you heard it here first!
