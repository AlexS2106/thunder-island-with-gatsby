excerpt: Lactose-free Cloud Bread made with eggs and coconut cream. It's strong enough and flexible enough to use for a sandwich and paleo-friendly.

<Ingredients>

### Ingredients
    
  - 3 medium eggs
  - 3 tbsp coconut cream
  - 1/2 tsp coconut oil

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Preheat a fan-assisted oven to 180 deg C or 345 deg F.
  - **Step 2**
    - Prepare a baking tray by covering it with baking paper.
    - With a pastry brush, brush the baking paper with coconut oil.
  - **Step 3**
    - Separate the eggs into two bowls, whites and yolks.
    - Whisk the egg whites until they make stiff peaks.
    - Add the coconut cream to the egg yolks and whisk.
    - Set the whisk aside and gently fold the yolk mixture into the egg whites; they will lose much of their stiffness.
  - **Step 4**
    - When everything is mixed, arrange spoonfuls of the mixture on the baking paper in about the size you want for the cloud bread.
    - Bake in the oven for 15 mins.
  - **Step 5**
    - After cooking, leave to cool before peeling the bread off the baking paper.
