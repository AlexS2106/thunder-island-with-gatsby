excerpt: Cloud Bread made with eggs and coconut cream. It's strong enough and flexible enough to hold a sandwich together without any added cheese.

<Ingredients>

### Ingredients
    
  - 3 medium eggs
  - 3 tbsp coconut cream
  - 1/2 tsp coconut oil

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

  - Peel, de-seed and dice the butternut squash.
  - Peel, top and tail, and dice the carrots.
  - Peel, core and dice the apple.
  - Dice the apple.

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Preheat a fan-assisted oven to 180 deg C or 345 deg F.
  - **Step 2**
    - Prepare a baking tray by covering it with baking paper.
    - With a pastry brush, brush the baking paper with the coconut oil.
  - **Step 3**
    - Separate the eggs into two bowls.
    - In one bowl, whisk the egg whites until they make stiff peaks.
    - In the other bowl, whisk the egg yolks and the coconut cream.
    - Set the whisk aside and gently fold the yolk mixture into the egg whites; the egg whites will lose a lot of their stiffness.
  - **Step 4**
    - When everything is mixed, transfer spoonfuls of the mixture over to the baking paper into the size you want for the bread.
    - Bake in the oven for 15 mins.
  - **Step 5**
    - After cooking, leave to cool before peeling the bread off the baking paper.

I use it for my bacon butties (known as bacon sandwiches outside my home county of Yorkshire). 

It’s possible to use it cold from the fridge, which I have, one day later.  It tends to take on a strange green tinge that is somewhat off-putting but tastes perfectly fine.  Think about when you boil an egg and leave it to cool on its own rather than in cold water; it has that same colouring but is still perfectly edible.  I don’t make them for anything more than one day ahead because of the risks associated with cold egg; but, it’s easy to make more when they can be ready in 25 minutes.

It is possible but unnecessary to butter the Cloud Bread, although my husband says it tastes better.  I say try it and see what you like.  If you wish to butter it, it’s best to melt the butter before spreading it else, it’s touch-and-go as to whether you end up ripping through the bread.
