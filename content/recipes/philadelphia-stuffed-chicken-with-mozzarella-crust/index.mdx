<Ingredients>

### Ingredients
    
  - 2 x 175g (medium) chicken breasts
  - 50 g (2oz) Philadelphia
  - 50 g (2 oz) shredded mozzarella
  - 1/2 tsp salt
  - 1/2 tsp black pepper
  - 1/4 tsp dried chives
  - 1/4 tsp dried tarragon

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

  - Peel, de-seed and dice the butternut squash.
  - Peel, top and tail, and dice the carrots.
  - Peel, core and dice the apple.
  - Dice the apple.

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Preheat a fan-assisted oven to 200 deg C.
  - **Step 2**
    - Season both sides of the chicken breasts with salt and pepper.
    - In a small bowl, mix the Philadelphia, chives and tarragon.
    - Slice sideways through each chicken breast to create a large pocket.
    - Push half the Philadelphia mixture into the 'pocket' of each chicken breast.
    - Smooth down the outer flesh of the chicken to seal the pocket.
  - **Step 3**
    - Place the chicken breasts on a baking tray.
    - Place the chicken in the oven and cook for 20 minutes.
  - **Step 4**
    - Remove the chicken breasts from the oven.
    - Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella on the top.
    - Return the chicken to the oven for a further 5 mins until the mozzarella has melted and started turning brown.
    - Make sure the chicken is cooked. A meat thermometer should read 75 deg C or 165 deg F, and the juices should run clear.
  - **Step 5**
    - Serve.

What is better than using cheese in a recipe? Using two kinds of cheese in a recipe! Philadelphia stuffed chicken with a mozzarella crust with not one but two cheeses. Oh, yum, yum! 

I struggled to make pockets in chicken breasts for a long time. I watched YouTube videos where some smiling person would swish a knife, and less than 20 seconds later, there was a perfectly cut chicken breast in front of them. Filled with a sense of purpose, off I would go. Ten minutes later, I would produce a raggedy cut with light shining through the chicken flesh, and, whatever I then stuffed, would bubble out when cooking. I have improved somewhat but still struggle with a good 'pocket cut' in chicken breasts. The only advice I can give from someone who struggles just the same is to make sure you use a sharp, flat-edged knife. Cut a bit, check the cut for light spots shining through, cut a bit more, check again, rinse and repeat. Keep going for only as long as it takes to make a decent-sized hole and edge on the side of caution at the expense of more stuffing.

To reassure you, I will tell you that if you mess up this recipe, it won't make much difference. Just scoop up the runaway cheese with the chicken when it's all cooked and serve. It will still taste delicious - appearance isn't everything! 

Technically, using Philadelphia or Mozzarella specifically isn't necessary. If you prefer another cream cheese or hard cheese brand instead, go ahead and try them. I used Philadelphia because it's my husband's favourite and the brand we generally have in the fridge. With the mozzarella, I used it for the same reason; I had some ready and grated waiting in my fridge. I recommend keeping with the herbs or adding alternatives if you like; herbs add just that bit more flavour to the chicken without adding carbs.
