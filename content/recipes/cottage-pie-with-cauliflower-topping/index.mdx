Keto Cottage Pie revamped into this new svelte version! 

Upon faced with this culinary magic, my resident taste-tester and keto-dieter declared. 'Oo! It's really nice. What did you do?' With such praise, this Keto Cottage Pie became a keeper.

Unfortunately, one of us is lactose intolerant – damn it! – and cannot indulge. I did try it without the cheeses, but it sadly lacks 'pizzazz' of any kind. Therefore I have no choice but to reserve this recipe exclusively for the keto bunch.

I always feel that pies are so quintessentially British that we have managed to make pie eating into an art form. You can't beat a good 'ole pie. Who says British food is boring? And let this statement lead me into making the rest of this post a history lesson for no particular reason other than 'All knowledge is worth having.' **Cite Anafiel Delauney from Kushiel's Dart by Jacqueline Carey. This fantastic book is not for the faint of heart or under 18's.** But, let me not digress and return to the no less fantastic but much less age-reserved history of British cuisine. 

Historically, the cottage pie was a pie of any meat topped with potatoes. This obviously was after potatoes were introduced in the late 16th century. The poor of Britain soon discovered they were easy to grow and super cheap. As such, they were quickly adopted into British cuisine and became a staple of home-cooking in houses of the poor. These said poor of Britain at the time lived in tiny houses called cottages – if only they knew those same little rustic cottages would cost a mint some 500 years later! Anyway, hence, the cottage pie came into being. 

We, British, obviously, do not like any culinary surprises whatsoever and would prefer to know what we are about to consume in advance. Ever helpful with descriptive communication, the English language came to the rescue and allowed us to adapt our pie names. A lamb cottage pie became a shepherd's pie because shepherds care for sheep. A pie with fish inside became, quite sensibly, a fisherman's pie. A pie with chicken became a chicken pie – admittedly, that one lacks originality. All this descriptive naming freed the term cottage pie to be used exclusively for beef. Perhaps, because we lacked cowboys and ranchers for a cowboy's pie or a rancher's pie? Whatever the reason, now you know that when you are faced with cottage pie, it will or rather should contain beef.

Now, throughout the country, British cooks have their traditional, often proudly announced (we aren't a very secretive bunch, to be honest), unique and special pie herb set. This herb set obviously makes our cottage pie far superior to 'Mabel's' next door! At the same time, the veggies are not so special. They tend to be what's in the kitchen and available to use, probably because we don't want to go to the shops because it's raining outside!
