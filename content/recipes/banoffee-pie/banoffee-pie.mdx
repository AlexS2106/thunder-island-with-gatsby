<Ingredients>

### Ingredients
    
  - 150 g McVities (or any brand) milk chocolate digestives
  - 90 g butter
  - 1 can (400g) Carnation caramel (boiled condensed milk)
  - 3 medium bananas
  - 280ml double cream (I prefer Elmlea over normal cream)
  - 1 square chocolate

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation
  - Break the biscuits up - either in the food processor or using a rolling pin.
  - Melt the butter to a liquid, make sure it doesn't cook.

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Mix the biscuits and the butter to form a paste-like mixture.
  - **Step 2**
    - Use the back of a spoon to flatten the biscuit mixture into the base of a tin about 23 cm (9 inches) wide.
    - Place the tin with the biscuit mix into the fridge and leave to harden for 1 hour.
  - **Step 3**
    - Spoon the Carnation caramel over the now hardened biscuit base and spread it around to evenly cover the biscuits.
  
  - **Step 4**
    - Thickly slice all 3 bananas.
    - Place them on top of the caramel in aingle layer. 
    - Start on the outside and make a circular pattern into the centre. 
    - This will take almost all of the 3 bananas although likely you will have a small bit of banana left over.
  - **Step 5**
    - Whip the cream.
    - Spoon the whipped cream evenly onto the bananas.
  - **Step 6**
    - Grate the square of chocolate on to the top of the cream.
  - **Step 7**
    - Serve immediately or keep in a fridge.
