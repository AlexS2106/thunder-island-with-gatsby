</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation
  - Peel, de-seed and slice the avocado.
  - Halve the tomatoes.

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - To make the scrambled eggs, melt the butter in a medium frying pan over a medium heat. ( I use number 5.)
    - Crack the eggs in a bowl, add the salt, and whisk with a fork.
    - Add the eggs to the frying pan, stir often.
    - When the eggs are mostly, but not entirely solid remove from the heat and divide equally between two plates.
  - **Step 2**
    - Equally divide all the ingredients onto two plates.
  - **Step 3**
    - Wrap a slice of avocado and some cream cheese inside the smoked salmon until the smoked salmon is used.
    - Serve.
