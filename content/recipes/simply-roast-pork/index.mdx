Would you believe I have spent over 15 years in Malta and I have yet to see a pig here... Or a sheep... Or a cow…

It's a part of the mysterious invisible animals of Malta, one of the magical mysteries of Malta.  While my native England has the usual mysteries like ghosts, black dogs, gigantic worms.  Malta has invisible farm animals.  There’s Maltese meat, milk, butter, cheese, sausages and yet not a single farm animal to be seen, zip, nada, not-a-one.  My Maltese friends assure me they are here while my friends from other countries and myself peer in every direction in the hopes of spotting one. So far, these invisible farm animals of Malta remain magically elusive…
