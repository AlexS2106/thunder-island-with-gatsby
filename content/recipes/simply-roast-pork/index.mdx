<Ingredients>

### Ingredients
    
  - 1.2 kg (2.6lb) boneless pork loin
  - 2 tbsp olive oil
  - 1 tsp salt

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

  - Remove the meat from the fridge 30 minutes before cooking.
  - Lightly score the meat with a sharp knife; stab the thicker bits of fat instead.

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Preheat a fan-assisted oven to 200째 C (400째 F).
  - **Step 2**
    - Rub the salt into the meat on all sides.
    - Rub the meat again with olive oil.
  - **Step 3**
    - Line a baking tray with aluminium foil.
    - Place the pork joint on top of the aluminium foil.
    - Place the tray in the oven.
    - Cook for 50 mins.
    - Insert a meat thermometer into the centre of the meat; it should read 70째 C (160째 F) or above. If not, return it to the oven for another 15 mins before trying again.
  - **Step 4**
    - Remove the meat from the oven and wrap the joint in the aluminium foil it was roasted on. Add a second layer of foil to cover the first.
    - Leave the meat to rest for 30 mins.
  - **Step 5**
    - Serve.

Would you believe I have spent over 15 years in Malta, and I have yet to see a pig, sheep or cow here.

The invisible animals are one of the magical mysteries of Malta. While my native England has the usual mysteries like ghosts, black dogs, and gigantic worms. Malta has invisible farm animals. There's Maltese meat, milk, butter, cheese, sausages and yet not a single farm animal to be seen, zip, nada, not-a-one. 

My Maltese friends assure me they are here, while my friends from other countries and I peer in every direction, hoping to spot one. So far, these invisible farm animals of Malta remain magically elusive and yet still manage to produce a pork joint or two for me!
