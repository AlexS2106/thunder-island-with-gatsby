<Ingredients>

### Ingredients
    
  - **To stuff the sea bream**
    - 2 x 450g (1 lb) sea bream
    - 20 g (1x small) finely diced shallot
    - 100 g (1x small) finely diced tomato
    - 2 x clove garlic
    - 1 pinch salt
    - 1 tbsp ghee
  - **To roast the sea bream**
    - 1 tbsp olive oil
    - 1 tsp lemon juice
    - 1 tsp dried rosemary
    - 1 tsp dried parsley
    - 1/8 tsp salt

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

  - If it isn't already, make sure the sea bream is descaled and gutted.
  - Finely dice the shallot.
  - Crush the garlic.

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Preheat a fan-assisted oven to 200 deg C or 400 deg F.
  - **Step 2**
    - Mix all the ingredients to stuff the sea bream, *but not the sea bream itself*.
    - On the hob in a small frying pan over medium heat (I use number 5.), pre-fry the stuffing ingredients until the shallots are soft. 
    - Remove from the heat.
  - **Step 3**
    - Mix the olive oil, rosemary, parsley, salt, and lemon juice.
    - Rub the mix evenly over both sea breams.
  - **Step 4**
    - Place the sea breams on a roasting tray.
    - Divide the stuffing ingredients from the frying pan evenly and place half each inside the sea breams' cavities.
    - Place in the oven and roast for 30 mins until cooked.
    - The fish is cooked when the spines along its back pull out easily, and the juices should run clear. A meat thermometer will read 63° C or 145° F.
  - **Step 5**
    - Serve.

Low Carb Paleo Sea Bream Stuffed With Tomatoes and Shallots is a recipe for my Mum. Personally, I find picking delicately through my dinner looking for almost invisible bones frustrating and, as such, rarely eat whole fish, but my Mum loves a fresh fish dinner. 

The sea bream (called sea bass) is a fish farmed in Maltese fishing waters and is relatively cheap on the island. So, when my parents visit, I experiment with a recipe of two.

There are plenty of different ways to cook sea bream out there, each one more fabulous than the next. This recipe is one of the simpler ones suitable for average size sea bream of about 400 – 450g. Sea bream can dry out a bit when you overcook them, and most recipes have a cooking time of around 15-20 minutes. For mine, I always give 30 minutes. Personal experience has given me under-cooked fish far more often than an overcooked one. Time and time again, I have put the fish back in the oven and completed a cooking time of 30 mins. Now, I set the timer for 30 minutes right from the beginning.
