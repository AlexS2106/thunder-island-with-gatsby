<Ingredients>

### Ingredients
    
  - **To stuff the sea bream**
    - 2 x 450g (1 lb) sea bream
    - 20 g (1x small) finely diced shallot
    - 100 g (1x small) finely diced tomato
    - 2 x clove garlic
    - 1 pinch salt
    - 1 tbsp ghee
  - **To roast the sea bream**
    - 1 tbsp olive oil
    - 1 tsp lemon juice
    - 1 tsp dried rosemary
    - 1 tsp dried parsley
    - 1/8 tsp salt

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

  - If it isn't already, make sure the sea bream is descaled and gutted.
  - Finely dice the shallot.
  - Finely dice the shallot.
  - Crush the garlic.

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Preheat a fan-assisted oven to 200 deg C or 400 deg F.
  - **Step 2**
    - Mix together all the ingredients to stuff the sea bream, *but not the sea bream itself*.
    - On the hob in a small frying pan over a medium heat (I use number 5.), pre-fry the stuffing ingredients until the shallots are soft. 
    - Remove from the heat.
  - **Step 3**
    - Mix the olive oil, dried rosemary, dried parsley, salt and lemon juice.
    - Rub the mix evenly over both sea breams.
  - **Step 4**
    - Place the sea breams on a roasting tray.
    - Divide the stuffing ingredients from the frying pan evenly and place half each inside the sea breams' cavities.
    - Place in the oven and roast for 30 mins until cooked.
    - The fish is cooked the spines along its back should pull out easily and the juices should run clear. A meat thermometer will read 63° C or 145° F.
  - **Step 5**
    - Serve.

Low Carb Paleo Sea Bream Stuffed with Tomatoes and Shallots is bit of a recipe anomaly for me becasue I rarely make fish recipes. Mostly because when I eat, I want to gobble. I find picking delicately through my dinner looking for almost invisible bones frustrating. It’s the main reason I don’t eat much fish and, when I do, I pick the big ones. However, my husband, Carl, and my mum, otherwise known as Daddy and Grandma, are of a different opinion. The sea bream (sometimes called sea bass) is a fish farmed in Maltese fishing waters and is relatively cheap in Malta; it’s great for culinary experimentation without breaking the bank.

There are plenty of different ways to cook sea bream out there, each one more fabulous than the next. This is one of the simpler ones suitable for average size sea bream of about 400 – 450g. They can dry out a bit when you overcook them, and most recipes will give a cooking time of around 15-20 minutes. To be honest, from personal experience, I have under-cooked my fish far more often than I have overcooked them. Time and time again, I have to put the fish back in the oven and complete a cooking time of 30 mins. Now, I just set the timer for 30 minutes right from the beginning.
