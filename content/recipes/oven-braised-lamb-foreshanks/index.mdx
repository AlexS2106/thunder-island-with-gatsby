### Instructions

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Preheat the oven to 150 deg C or 300 deg F.
  - **Step 2**
    - Pat dry the lamb shanks.
    - Rub the salt on all sides.
  - **Step 3**
    - Melt the lard in a large pan on the hob.
    - Sear all sides of both the lamb shanks to brown. You might need to hold the shanks in place to get them browned on all the sides.
    - Remove the shanks and set them aside.
  - **Step 4**
    - Let the frying pan cool a little.
    - Pour the chicken stock into the pan and use a fish slice to scrape off any browned bits stuck to the bottom.
    - Scrape the chicken stock from the frying pan into a baking tray with high sides.
    - Add the browned shanks to the baking tray.
    - Cover the baking tray with aluminium foil to make a closed environment to cook the shanks.
  - **Step 5**
    - Roast for 3 hours undisturbed.
  - **Step 6**
    - Serve with the juices as gravy.
