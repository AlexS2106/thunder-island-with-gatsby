### Ingredients

  - 2x pork chops

  - 1/2 tbsp honey
  - 1/2 tsp salt

### Instructions

#### Preparation

  - Peel, core, and finely chop the apple.
  - Remove the pork chops from the fridge about 20 minutes before cooking.

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Mix the salt and pepper and rub all sides of the pork chops.
  - **Step 2**
    - Melt the butter in a medium frying pan over medium to high heat.
    - Add the pork chops to the pan.
    - Sear the pork chops on one side for 3 mins, then turn over and sear the other side for 2 mins.

    - Keep the pan with the juices on the hob.
  - **Step 3**
    - Turn the hob heat down to medium.
  - **Step 4**
    - Mix the apple, honey, water and cinnamon in a small bowl.
    - Add the mixture to the same frying pan in which you cooked the pork chops.
    - Fry the ingredients for about 5-10 minutes until the apples are soft; stir often.
  - **Step 5**
    - Unwrap the pork chops from the aluminium foil and arrange them on plates.
    - Spoon the apple cinnamon sauce directly on top of the chops.
