<Ingredients>

### Ingredients
    
- **For the Marinade**
  - 4 lamb chops
  - 25 g shallots
  - 3 tbsp olive oil
  - 1 tbsp white vinegar
  - 1/2 tsp salt
  - 1/4 tsp black pepper
  - 1/2 tsp garlic powder
  - 1/4 tsp allspice
  - 1/8 tsp turmeric
- **For the Sauce**
  - 100 g mushrooms
  - 100 ml coconut cream

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

  - Finely chop the shallots.
  - Slice the mushrooms.
  - Marinate the lamb chops. (See step 1)
  - Remove the chops from the fridge about 30 minutes before cooking to warm up.

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Place the lamb chops and all the marinade ingredients, shallots, vinegar, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, olive oil, allspice and turmeric in a marinating bag.
    - Leave in the fridge for 4 hours.
  - **Step 2**
    - Remove the chops from the marinade, but **do not** discard the marinade. 
    - Place each chop separately on a baking tray.
  - **Step 3**
    - Turn the grill on medium-high heat.
    - When it's hot, grill the chops for 7 mins on each side.
  - **Step 4**
    - While the chops are grilling, melt the ghee in a saucepan over medium heat. (I use number 5.)
    - Add the mushrooms and the remaining marinade.
    - Cook for about 5 minutes until the marinade is hot and the mushrooms soften.
    - Add the coconut cream and stir continuously for 5 mins until the cream is warmed.
  - **Step 5**
    - To serve, place each chop onto a plate and pour half of the creamy mushroom sauce over each.
