A bowl of beef cubes is my alternative to the recent rise of vegetarianism and veganism, ‘the buddha bowl’. For those who have yet to encounter the ‘buddha bowl’, it is simply a bowl piled high with different veggies. It’s filling and delicious. Unfortunately, however, it has no meat. While the animal lover in me would really like to be vegetarian, the real me requires daily meat sustenance. Cue my carnivorous alternative!


Having spent year upon year as a shift worker, I know that it is almost impossible to eat healthily.  What helped me the most was a slow cooker. A slow cooker is worth it’s weight in gold! This is a meal I developed specifically for the slow cooker. 


Let me explain the scenario! Read carefully, and let me convert you. You’ll be off and buying a slow cooker in five minutes.


You prep everything up before work when you have plenty of time. You turn on the slow cooker as you walk out the door to work. 


Whilst you wish, with sadness and longing, that you were anywhere else but work, that slow cooker is doing its magic. The meat is softening and becoming juicy and delicious. The veggies are cooking, marinating in delicious liquid. The stock mixes with the delicious oozings from the meat and veggies.  This is what awaits you. Remember this as your shift finally ends.


Then, at the end of work, instead of thinking. ‘I am hungry, I want food, but I am too tired to cook.’ You can, instead, think to yourself. ‘Aha! I have a wonderful, tasty dinner waiting just for me at home.’
This thought lets you drive past that all-night garage with its ready-made pastries, crisps and chocolate bars that you have spent a small fortune in. It will stop you from heading to the all-night supermarket for calorie-laden pizza.  This thought will get you home. 


Then, at home, when you are tired, when you don’t want to cook, when you don’t have much time to sleep before you have to get up again for the next shift, you will have this tasty, delicious and healthy hot meal ready and waiting. 


The smell drifts and winds through your home. It embraces you as you open your door.  It tempts and teases as you climb into your comfy pj’s. Then, when you finally tuck in, it tastes absolutely delicious, fills you up and, guess what? It’s actually healthy for you too!
