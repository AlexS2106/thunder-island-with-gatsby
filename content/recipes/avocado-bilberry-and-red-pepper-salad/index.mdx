Avocado, Bilberry, And Red Pepper Salad resulted from an avocado phase I had. My avocado phase happened around the same time as everyone else's when avocados knocked eggs off the superfood top spot and spent a few years as the internet's darling - healthy fats, low net carbs etc. Now, my avocado phase has ended, but the result is a good number of tasty recipes. Avocado, Bilberry, And Red Pepper Salad is one of my favourites; I think the avocado and bilberry combination makes it. 

I have to share, as well, what I discovered when I sat down to write this post - something that made me feel like a total wally! I have been under the blissfully ignorant illusion that blueberries and bilberries were the same fruit for over forty years. I thought it was one of those across-the-ocean differences like pavement and sidewalk. Blueberries came with an American accent – "blooo-beyyreeez" while bilberries came with a British one – 'bill burrizz'. Now, I discover I've been had!  

According to others, who are far wiser than I, they are a different fruit altogether. Bilberries are slightly smaller, darker, and a bit more vitamin-rich than blueberries. Blueberries were originally from America and were introduced to Europe, while bilberries are natively from Northern Europe. You are likely buying blueberries in your local supermarket because bilberries don't transport very well. In short, bilberries are the small and mighty version, whereas blueberries are in for the long haul. Next, they'll tell me a sidewalk is in the middle of the road!

For this recipe, use either blackberries or bilberries. It'll taste just as good with either!
