Avocado, bilberry and red pepper salad came about as a result of my ‘avocado’ phase. Said avocado phase happened around the same time as everyone else’s avocado phase. This was when avocados knocked eggs off the superfood top spot and spent a few years as the darling of the internet.  Healthy fats, low net carbs etc. My avocado phase has ended now with hubby and I indulging in avocados occasionally instead of a bi-weekly basis, but while it lasted, it did result in a good number of tasty recipes for me to use as and when the feeling arises. 
 
This recipe is one of my favourites.  But I think it’s the avocado and bilberry combination that makes it so.  I have to share, as well, what I discovered when I sat down to write this post which made me feel like a total wally!  I have been for forty years now under the blissfully ignorant illusion that blueberries and bilberries were the same things. I thought it was like the difference between a pavement and a sidewalk.  Blueberries were said with an American accent – “blooo-beyyreeez” while bilberries came with a British one – ‘bill burrizz’.  Now, I discover I’ve been had!  


According to others, who are obviously far wiser than I, they are a different fruit altogether. Bilberries are very slightly smaller, very slightly darker and are a tiny bit more vitamin-rich than blueberries. Blueberries were originally from America and were introduced to Europe, while bilberries are natively from Northern Europe. In your local supermarket, it is more than likely you are buying blueberries purely because bilberries don’t transport very well. In short, bilberries are the small and mighty version, whereas blueberries are in for the long haul. Next, they’ll tell me a sidewalk is in the middle of the road!
For the purposes of my recipes, however, let’s not confuse anything – use bilberries or blueberries, whatever you can get your hands on because nobody is going to care!
