  - 2 X 200 g salmon fillets
  - 125 mls (½ cup) coconut cream

  - ½ tsp salt
  - 2 pinches salt

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

  -  Remove the salmon fillets from the fridge 30 minutes before cooking to warm up.

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Use kitchen paper and pat both sides of the salmon dry.
    - Use the two pinches of salt and sprinkle over the salmon fillets. Rub in.
  - **Step 2**
    - Heat the olive oil in a medium frying pan on a low to medium heat. (I use number 4.)
  - **Step 3**
    - When the oil is heated, add the salmon skin side down.
    - Fry the salmon 5 minutes on one side, flip over and cook for 5 minutes on the other side.
    - When cooked, a meat thermometer should read 48-52° C or 120-125° F, remove from heat and wrap in aluminium foil to keep warm. 
    - Remove the salmon, set aside and cover.
  - **Step 4**
    - Add the coconut cream and stock cube to the same pan. Stir until the cube has dissolved into the cream.
    - Add the remaining ingredients, dill, lemon juice, salt and garlic powder and simmer for 5 minutes.
  - **Step 5**
    - To serve unwrap and plate the salmon before pour the coconut dill sauce on top.
