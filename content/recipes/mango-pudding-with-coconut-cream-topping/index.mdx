<Ingredients>

### Ingredients
    
  - 1 medium mango
  - 250 ml (1 cup) coconut cream 
  - 1 tbsp gelatin powder
  - 60 ml (1/4 cup) cold water 
  - 1/2 tsp honey
  - pinch of unsweetened cocoa powder

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

  - Destone and peel the mango.

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Place the mango in a food processor and blend until it becomes a puree.
  - **Step 2**
    - Remove about 3 tbsp of the most solid part of the coconut cream and leave it in the fridge.
  - **Step 3**
    - In a bowl mix the gelatin with the cold water and leave for about 5 mins to thicken.
  - **Step 4**
    - Meanwhile, in a saucepan, place the rest of the coconut cream and the mango puree.
    - Gently heat the mango/coconut cream mixture on a low heat until it's **almost** hot.
  - **Step 5**
    - Pour the gelatin mix into the mango/coconut mix and stir for about 3 mins.
  - **Step 6**
    - Remove from the heat and pour into a serving bowl.
    - Place the bowl into the fridge to harden. This will take around 3 hours.
  - **Step 7**
    - When ready to serve, whisk the coconut cream that you set aside in the fridge earlier. 
    - Spoon the whipped cream onto the top of the hardened mango pudding.
    - Drip the honey onto the pudding.
    - Sprinkle the cocoa powder onto the pudding.
    - Serve.
