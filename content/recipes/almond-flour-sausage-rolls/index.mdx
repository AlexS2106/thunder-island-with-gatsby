<Ingredients>

  - 200 g (2 cups) almond flour
  - 2 x medium eggs
  - 1½ tbsp ghee or butter
  - 1/4 tsp salt

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Preheat a fan-assisted oven to 175°C or 350°F.
    - Line a baking tray with baking paper.
  - **Step 2**
    - Mix the almond flour, eggs, 1½ tbsp of butter and salt together to form a sticky pastry.
    - Divide the pastry into 6 parts.
  - **Step 3**
    - Take two squares of clingfilm and lay one square down.
    - Roll one part of the pastry into a cylinder and place it on the clingfilm.
    - Lay the second square of clingfilm over the pastry.
    - Use your rolling pin to roll over the top of the second clingfilm until the pastry is big enough to wrap around a sausage, plus an extra 2cm (about ¾ inch) to form a lip.
    - Remove the top layer of clingfilm, and place your sausage at one edge.
    - Use the clingfilm at the bottom to smooth the pastry around the sausage.
    - When the pastry is wrapped around the sausage, pick up the sausage and smooth the lip of pastry over the other side to keep the pastry sealed.
    - Place the sausage roll onto the baking paper.
    - Repeat until all the sausages are done.
    - See below for more in depth help on how to roll the sausages up.
  - **Step 4**
    - Bake in the centre of the oven for 30 mins. 
    - Turn half way through.
  - **Step 5**
    - Serve hot or cold.

#### Making Keto Tasty Sausage Rolls without Cheese Step by Step

This recipe is just enough for 10 small sausages or 6 medium-sized sausages, or 4 large sausages.  There is little to nothing left over.  So, divide the pastry into these amounts first.  That way, you don’t use too much or too little and end up with a problem one sausage from the end.  I eyeball it, but if you aren’t sure, weigh it out instead, whatever is easiest for you.

Next, cut two small squares of clingfilm. (I believe in America, this is called plastic wrap or saran wrap.) Lay one square down on a flat surface. Roll one portion of the pastry between your hands into an oblong shape. Place it onto the clingfilm. Place the other piece of clingfilm on top.

Then, use a rolling pin and roll it out to roughly the width of your sausage, long enough to wrap around the sausage plus about 1-2 cm extra in length. The spare is because the pastry will contract a bit when baking. If you don’t have that extra, it will pull apart.  If it does, it will still taste just as fabulous. Still, we might as well aim for aesthetically pleasing just to impress the taste testers. Trim the extra pastry with a knife, pull it away and add it to another portion instead.

A small side note on this for those thinking of ditching this step – the clingfilm is necessary. Until I included the clingfilm, it was a torturous nightmare trying to get the pastry to stick to the sausage and not the rolling pin. And, till now, I haven’t been able to think of another way to make this recipe that doesn’t involve clingfilm.

Once you are confident in the size and shape of the pastry you’ve rolled, place your sausage at one end and roll it around the sausage. Use the clingfilm to do this, or else the pastry will stick to your hands. Finally, press down a little on your pastry seam to seal the sausage roll.

Transfer your newly rolled Keto Tasty Sausage Roll without Cheese onto a lined baking tray. Then, rinse and repeat.
