<Ingredients>

### Ingredients
    
  - 1.2 kg (2 1/2 lb) boneless lamb shoulder
  - 2 tbsp olive oil
  - 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
  - 1/2 tbsp lard
  - 1 tsp salt
  - 1 tsp black pepper
  - 1 tsp dried coriander
  - 1 tsp dried cumin
  - 1/2 tsp garlic powder
  - 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
  - 1/2 tsp mustard powder
  - few leaves parsley (optional for garnish)

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

  - Remove the lamb from the fridge about 1 hour before cooking to warm up.

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Preheat a fan-assisted oven to 150 deg C or 300 deg F.
    - Prepare a roasting tray and line it with enough aluminium foil to cover the whole of the lamb.
  - **Step 2**
    - Melt the ghee in a medium frying pan on the hob on high heat. (I use number 9.)
  - **Step 3**
    - In a bowl, mix the olive oil, salt, black pepper, coriander, cumin, garlic powder, smoked paprika, and mustard powder.
    - Rub the oil/spice mix over the whole lamb, and make sure the whole of the lamb is covered.
  - **Step 4**
    - When the lard is sizzling, place the lamb in the frying pan.
    - Slowly turn the lamb and sear all sides of the meat. 
    - When the lamb is browned, remove it from the frying pan and place it in the aluminium foil in the roasting tray. 
    - Remove the pan from the heat and let it cool a little.
    - When the pan is cool enough, add the apple cider vinegar and scrape around the base of the pan to get any left behind brown bits. 
    - Pour the vinegar and scraped bits over the top of the lamb.
  - **Step 5**
    - Cover the lamb with the aluminium foil; try to avoid the foil from touching the top of the lamb.
    - Place the lamb in the oven and roast for 3 hours.
  - **Step 6**
    - Remove the lamb from the oven and let it rest for 20 mins inside the foil.
    - Uncover and sprinkle with the parsley garnish if desired.
    - Serve.
