<Ingredients>

### Ingredients
    
  - 2x 225g (8oz) sirloin steaks of 2cm (3/4 inch) thickness
  - 1 tbsp ghee or butter
  - 1/4 tsp salt
  - 1/4 tsp black pepper

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation
  - Remove the steak from the fridge about 15 minutes before cooking.
  - Calculate the steak cooking time:
    - Rare: 1 minute 30 seconds per side
    - Medium: 2 minutes per side
    - Well done: 4 minutes per side

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Melt the ghee in a frying pan on a medium high heat. (I use number 7.)
  - **Step 2**
    - Pat the steaks dry with kitchen paper.
    - Rub salt and pepper onto all sides.
  - **Step 3**
    - When the pan is hot, add the steaks.
    - Time the meat - don't guess. (See preparation)
    - When the timer finishes, turn the steaks and reset the timerk.
    - When the timer rings the second time, it's all done.
  - **Step 4**
    -  Serve the steak in the pan juices.

</Instructions>
