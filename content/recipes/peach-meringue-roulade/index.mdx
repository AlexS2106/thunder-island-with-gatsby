<Ingredients>

### Ingredients
    
  - 6 x eggs
  - 300g sugar
  - 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
  - 1x tin sliced peaches
  - 1 tub Elmlea whipping cream(or any whipping cream)

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

  - Drain the peaches, and use the juice for something else.
  - Separate the whites of the eggs, and use the yolks for something else.

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Pre-heat a fan-assisted oven to 180 deg C.
    - Prepare a baking sheet on a baking tray.
  - **Step 2**
    - Whisk the egg whites into stiff peaks.
  - **Step 3**
    - Slowly add the sugar while whisking.
    - Add the vanilla extract.
    - Keep whisking till all the sugar and vanilla extract are incorporated into the egg whites. The mix should look shiny.
  - **Step 4**
    - Spoon the mix onto the baking sheet in a long rectangle shape.
  - **Step 5**
    - Bake in the centre of the oven for 15 minutes.
    - When ready, remove from the oven and let cool.
  - **Step 6**
    - When the meringue is cool, lift the baking sheet with the meringue on top onto a flat surface.
    - Turn so the meringue is now on the bottom and the baking sheet is on the top, and gently peel off the baking sheet.
    - Place the baking sheet down and slide it under the meringue with the meringue still upside down.
  - **Step 6**
    - Whisk the cream, and spoon it all over the meringue. It's unnecessary to go right to the edges.
  - **Step 7**
    - Scatter the peaches over the cream.
  - **Step 8**
    - Use the baking sheet to roll the meringue with your hands until it's in one 'log'; discard the baking sheet.
  - **Step 9**
    - Serve chilled. 

</Instructions>
