Tinned Tuna and Goats' Cheese Salad is a great way to use those tinned tuna packs that hang around on the shelf. If your kitchen is anything like mine, tinned tuna is one of those things left at the back of the cupboard after everything else has gone. It's not that tinned tuna tastes terrible. It lacks that 'Yeah!' factor when considering one's luncheon options.

'Shall we have tinned tuna for lunch today, dear?'

See what I mean?

Well, this salad might be the way to make tinned tuna just that bit more interesting. So grab a small pack of goats' cheese and some essential low-carb salad ingredients next time you're at the supermarket. Then, one lovely day, 'Bob's your uncle' (For other countries wondering what Bob has to do with anything, this is a commonly used British expression that means 'There you go! All done!'.) -  a lunchtime salad that's ready in no time!
