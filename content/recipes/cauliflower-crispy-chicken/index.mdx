  - 1 tbsp lard
  - 1 tsp sweet paprika
  - 1 tsp smoked paprika

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

  - In a food processor, blitz the cauliflower into rice.

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Mix the sweet paprika, smoked paprika, salt, black pepper, allspice, nutmeg, ginger, and mustard on a plate.
    - Place the beaten egg on another plate.
    - Place the cauliflower rice on a third plate.
  - **Step 2**
    - Beat the chicken breasts to flatten them until they are no more than 2cm (3/4 inch) in thickness.
    - Dip each breast into the herb mix, coat one side, then the other.
    - Then, dip the breasts into the egg, coat one side, then the other.
    - Then, dip the chicken into the cauliflower mix, coat one side,  then the other. 
    - Use your fingers to put some more cauliflower on any sparse areas.
  - **Step 3**
    - Melt the lard on medium-high heat (I use number 7).
    - When the lard is hot, fry the chicken for 5 minutes on each side. 
    - Try not to move the chicken around the pan too much.
    - Remove the chicken from the heat when cooked through.
  - **Step 4**
    - Serve.
