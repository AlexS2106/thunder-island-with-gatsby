<Ingredients>

### Ingredients
    
  - 1.6 kg (about 3 1/2 lbs) boneless lamb shoulder
  - 2 tbsp olive oil
  - 1/2 tsp salt
  - 1/2 tsp dried rosemary
  - 1/4 tsp garlic powder
  - 1/4 tsp black pepper


</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

  - Remove the lamb from the fridge for 1 hour to warm to room temperature.

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Preheat a fan-assisted oven to 150 deg C or 300 deg F.
  - **Step 2**
    - Pat dry the lamb with kitchen paper and pierce it several times with a sharp knife.
    - Mix the salt, garlic powder and black pepper and rub thoroughly into the lamb.
    - Rub the lamb on all sides with olive oil.
    - Place the lamb on a baking tray.
    - Sprinkle the dried rosemary over the top of the lamb.
    - Cover the lamb with aluminium foil. Try to make sure the foil doesn't touch the lamb itself.
  - **Step 3**
    - Roast in the oven for 2 1/2 hours.
    - Remove the aluminium foil and keep it to one side.
    - Return the lamb to the oven and cook for a further 30 mins.
    - Remove the lamb when it's cooked. A meat thermometer should read above 63 deg C or 145 deg F. If it doesn't, return it to the oven and check again in 30 mins.
  - **Step 4**
    - Once cooked, wrap the meat tightly in the aluminium foil set aside from earlier.
    - Leave to rest for 30 mins.
  - **Step 5**
    - Serve.
