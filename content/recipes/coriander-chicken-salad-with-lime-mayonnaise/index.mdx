### Instructions

#### Preparation
  - Marinate the chicken. (Step 1)
  - Remove the marinated chicken from the fridge 30 minutes before cooking.
  - Roughly chop the lettuce.
  - Dice the tomatoes.

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Add all the marinating ingredients with the chicken together in a bag.
    - Make sure the chicken breasts are completely covered by the marinade.
    - Leave to marinate in the fridge between 2 and 4 hours.
  - **Step 2**
    - Heat the olive oil in a frying pan on a medium heat. (I use the number 6.).
    - Remove the chicken from the marinade and place into the oil.
    - Discard the remaining marinade.
    - Fry the chicken for 7 mins on each side. 
    - The chicken is done when a meat thermometer says 75 deg C,165 deg F or the juices run clear.
    - Remove the chicken, cover and set aside to rest for 5 minutes.
  - **Step 3**
    - Mix the lettuce and tomato and divide it all equally onto two plates.
    - Slice the chicken and arrange on top.
  - **Step 4**
    - Combine the mayonnaise with the lime juice, coriander and salt.
    - Pour equal amounts of the lime mayonnaise over the top of the chicken breast.
  - **Step 5**
