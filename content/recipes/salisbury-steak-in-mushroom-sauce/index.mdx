### Instructions

#### Preparation

  - Finely chop the fennel.
  - Crush the garlic.

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - In a large bowl, mix the beef mince, egg, garlic, fennel, vinegar, salt, black pepper, thyme and garlic powder. 
    - Mix everything together by thoroughly squishing it through your fingers.
    - When the texture of the meat becomes smooth, it's ready.
    - Pat into 4 equal size steaks.
  - **Step 2**
    - Heat the lard in a large frying pan on a medium heat (I use number 6).
  - **Step 3**
    - When the lard is hot, carefully place the steaks into the frying pan. 
    - Fry 10 mins on one side. 
    - Carefully turn them over and brown on the other side for a further 10 mins.
    - When the juices run clear the steaks are done. Remove, set aside and cover.
  - **Step 4**
    - Using the same frying pan, add the olive oil for the sauce.
    - Fry the fennel and mushrooms until soft, stir often.
    - Add the coconut cream and the beef stock cube and stir well.
    - When the coconut cream is warm and the stock cube has dissolved, remove from the heat.
  - **Step 5**
    - Serve one salisbury steak per person with a quarter of the sauce on top.
