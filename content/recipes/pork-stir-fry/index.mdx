Pork Stir Fry was one of those accidental recipes where you look in the fridge, and various items give you the limp 'use-me-soon' wave. You put everything all together in the hope that they will taste right in the end and discover you made something that tastes great. Luckily for me, they did, and I have made the same stir fry on purpose many times since. 

I primarily use pork medallions in this dish because they are among the most common cuts in the Maltese butcher shops but replace this with any cut you like. I find that pork lends best to flash-frying, so don't be afraid to turn the heat up and make sure you don't overcook it.

I use a spiraliser to give the carrots a more noodle-like appearance and a more authentic-looking stir fry overall. The thin spirals also cook quicker, keeping up with the other ingredients. You can grate or chop the carrots if you do not have a spiraliser. However, if you happen to chop them, precooking them in a microwave for 1 minute or two to soften them before cooking is a good idea.

Another thing I often do is use frozen veggies, presliced mixed bell peppers, and onions to make the stir fry. The resulting veggies end up a little softer, but it tastes just the same and makes weeknight cooking that much easier.

I use ghee as my go-to fat to cook in because I like the additional buttery flavour without the lactose. However, it's not an important part of the stir fry, so feel free to use another oil or fat to suit.

Anyone who has gone through my recipes will know I prefer using dried herbs. Why? Because they take a long time to go off and save me money! Fresh herbs have their place, but dried herbs make life easier; however, if you prefer fresh, swap them in.

One of the dominant herbs in this recipe is good old cumin. I have to say I have a love-hate relationship with cumin. I find the taste of cumin can very quickly become overpowering. It goes from can't taste it to way too much in a heartbeat, and then all you have is cumin. The recipe gives that perfect amount for me; for you, it might be too little or too much, but the entire recipe is flexible - adjust to suit.
