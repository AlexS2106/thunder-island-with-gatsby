Pork stir fry was one of those accidental recipes where you look in the fridge, various items give you the limp ‘use-me-soon’ wave, so you put them all together in the hope that they will taste all right in the end. Luckily for me, they did. The end result has been me making the same stir fry on purpose many times since. 

This is an easy recipe that just happens to be healthy too.Often with stir-fries, they need Worcestershire sauce or fish sauce or some other kind of non-paleo sauce to make them tasty. The added ingredient usually destroys the health benefits of all the other ingredients. The result? Yep, those painful and embarrassing digestive issues within the hour. This recipe replaces those sauces with just a few herbs instead.

I have primarily used pork medallions in this dish just because they are among the most common cuts in the Maltese butcher shops. However, even the best cuts of pork are relatively cheap, so go wild and use what you will. Pork lends best to flash-frying, I find, so don’t be afraid to turn the heat up and make sure you don’t overcook it.

I have a spiraliser and use it to give the carrots a more noodle-like appearance and a more authentic looking stir fry overall. The thin spirals also cook quicker, so they keep up with the other ingredients. If you do not have a spiraliser, you can either grate or chop.  If you happen to chop them, it’s a good idea to precook them in a microwave for 1 minute or two to soften them up and match the other veggie ingredients.

another thing I often do here is use frozen products. I defrosted some presliced mixed bell peppers just to make this truly lazy. Just keep in mind frozen peppers, once defrosted, end up a lot softer than their fridged self-chopped counterparts.

I use ghee as my go-to fat to cook in. I like the buttery flavour without the lactose. However, it's not an important part of the stir fry so feel free to use another oil or fat to suit.

Anyone who has gone through a few of my recipes will know I prefer using dried herbs. Why? Because they take a long time to go off and save me money! Fresh herbs have their place… in the fridge before they go off! But, dried just makes life easier.

One of the dominant herbs in this recipe is good old cumin. I have to say I have a love-hate relationship with cumin. I find the taste of cumin is very quickly overpowering. It goes from can’t taste it to way too much in a heartbeat, and then all you have is cumin. Be careful with the cumin! Paprika, even smoked paprika, is a lot more forgiving, and you can go way too far before way too far is too far. Having said that, everyone is different. Use the recipe herbs as stated, then taste and adjust!
