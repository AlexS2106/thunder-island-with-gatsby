This simple, salted salmon fillet recipe was one of my earliest discoveries when I started the paleo diet and with it, my experimenting in the kitchen. I had previously found a nice looking recipe for salmon on the internet and set about with my salmon, salt and lemons.

A little while later, I forced down my salted lemons with a moderately fishy aftertaste.  Yummy… err… no, definitely not! As I am not the biggest fan of seafood anyway, it put me off any fish for quite some time. That is until, spurred on by the knowledge that fish is healthy and that I should force down some fish, I thought I might try again. This time though, I would try without lemons! 

I tried desperately to find a fish recipe without lemons. It should have been easy, but it wasn’t. There seems to be some unwritten law forcing the general population to have lemons with fish. It’s not that I particularly mind lemons with my fish, but it would be nice to go without as well. Eventually, I gave up searching and figure it out for myself, and this is the recipe exactly the same many years later.
