Simply Salmon Fillet was one of my earliest recipes when I started the paleo diet and my experimenting in the kitchen. 

My first try at cooking salmon was a nice-looking recipe for salmon on the internet, which involved the salmon, some salt and lemons; my result was salted lemons with a moderately fishy aftertaste. A few different recipes later, things had not improved. It put me off any fish for quite some time. 

Eventually, spurred on by the knowledge that fish is healthy, I made an effort to try again. This time though, I would try without lemons! I tried desperately to find a fish recipe without lemons. It should have been easy, but it wasn't. There seems to be some unwritten law forcing the general population to have lemons with fish. It's not that I mind lemons with my fish, but, having recipe after recipe fail so miserably, it would be nice to go without them. 

Eventually, I gave up searching and made the fish as plain as possible - just like this!
