<Ingredients>

### Ingredients

  - 1 tbsp coconut flour
  - 3 tbsp coconut cream
  - 1 tbsp water
  - 1 x medium egg
  - pinch salt
  - 1/2 tbsp ghee

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Mix the almond flour, coconut flour, coconut cream, water and salt in a bowl and let it sit for 5 mins.
  - **Step 2**
    - Melt the ghee in a small frying pan over medium heat. (I use number 6.)
  - **Step 3**
    - When the ghee is hot, pour in the flatbread mix. Tip the pan, so the mixture spreads out over the bottom of the pan.
    - Cook for about 5 mins. 
    - When the top of the bread is set, use a fish slice and flip the bread over.
    - Cook for another 5 mins on the other side.
  - **Step 4**
    - Serve.

Low Carb Skillet Flatbread ticks lots of weeknight dinner boxes. It's simple, fast and filling with the fewest possible ingredients. The ingredients are measured with a tablespoon or half of one for speed and easy clean-up, and everything can be thrown into a bowl in any particular order. It's super easy to make; if you can flip an omelette, you can make this skillet bread. And, when cooked, the flatbread is nicely filling, making you feel like you have eaten a good dinner after having it.

The only downside to this recipe is the unfortunate need to stand at the hob. I tried it in the oven, where it quite nicely welded itself to the baking tin and took three runs through a dishwasher to come clean.

It is tempting to reduce or remove the ghee from the ingredient list; unfortunately, the ghee is necessary because coconut flour soaks up everything. I found that Â½ tbsp of the ghee was the exact amount needed to prevent sticking but not be wasteful. 

When using this bread, try to think of it as a slice of naan bread. It won't wrap a burger or hold your sandwich spread, but it will soak up your curry or deliciously bulk up your stew. Those who lived their entire lives having slices of white bread with every meal might find this an acceptable alternative for the job. 

I left this flatbread recipe quite plain. I always like to give the simplest recipe versions first and experiment later but adding some thyme and rosemary, or garlic, or even a little cinnamon and honey are tasty embellishments.
