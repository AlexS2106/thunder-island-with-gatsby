### Instructions

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Mix the almond flour, coconut flour, coconut cream, water and salt in a bowl and let it sit for 5 mins.
  - **Step 2**
    - Melt the ghee in a small frying pan over a medium heat. (I use number 6.)
  - **Step 3**
    - When the ghee is hot, pour in the flatbread mix. Tip the pan about, so the mixture spreads out over the bottom of the pan.
    - Cook for about 5 mins. 
    - When the top of the bread is just set, use a fish slice and flip the bread over.
    - Cook for another 5 mins on the other side.
  - **Step 4**
    - Serve.

Low carb skillet flatbread ticks lots of family weeknight dinner boxes. It’s simple, fast and filling.

At the moment, preparing for the evening meal is the equivalent of having already run a marathon, only to find oneself standing at the bottom of Mount Everest fully aware it must be climbed before dinnertime. Meanwhile, two determined midgets circle your position with demands, questions and screaming…  A cooped-up-at-home-all-day-somewhat-frazzled-parent... Who? Me?  Yep, lockdown number two in Malta has begun…

This flatbread has the fewest ingredients possible, all measured with a tablespoon or half of one for speed and easy clean-up. You can throw everything into a bowl in any particular order, which is always a good thing. It’s nicely filling, making you feel like you have actually eaten a good dinner after having it. And, last but not least, it’s super easy to make; if you can make and flip an omelette, you can make and flip this skillet bread.  The only downside it has is the unfortunate need to stand at the hob. I did try it in the oven, where it quite nicely welded itself to the baking tin and took three runs through a dishwasher to get the tray clean, so let’s not try that again. However, it only takes ten minutes at the hob, not exactly a disaster, and all you have to do is prod the top to see when it’s firm. Easy as!

The ghee is absolutely necessary. Coconut flour soaks everything up. I found that ½ tbsp of fat was the exact amount needed to prevent sticking but not be wasteful. 

When using this bread, try to think of it as the bread in a basket you might get in a restaurant or as a slice of naan bread. It won’t wrap a burger or hold your sandwich spread but what it will do is soak up your curry or deliciously bulk up your stew. Those who lived their entire lives having slices of white bread with every meal might find this an acceptable alternative for the job. 

I purposefully left this quite plain. I always like to give the simplest recipe versions before any embellishments are made. Often, we find it’s best to taste the original and then add your own as everyone’s taste is different. If you wish, add in some thyme and rosemary, or garlic, or even a little bit of cinnamon and honey.
