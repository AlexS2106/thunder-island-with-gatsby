Pork rib with smoked paprika and thyme rub is one of the more simple carnivore recipes because you cannot beat a great big chunk of meat for sheer tummy satisfaction! Currently, I only have one recipe for spare ribs and a rather honey laden one at that; so, I decided another, more universally friendly, recipe was in order. Okay, this only makes two now, but two is twice as good as one. I chose this one because it’s the one with the least number of ingredients. I find that most people prefer my simple recipes. Those with 20 different ingredients, no matter how great they are, tend to be intimidating.

You could literally use any combination of herbs you like here, but this is a great place to start experimenting, and the simplicity of the ingredients lets you neglect the meat in the oven, and it will still turn out great.

Spare ribs tend to have a lot less meat than their beefier (porkier?) alternative, baby back ribs. However, spare ribs are the cheaper of the two and, we also find, the tastier of the two.  One spare rib usually gives about 225g of meat without the bones making half about 110g of meat per person. If you prefer a bit more meat on your plate, make one rib per person. If you decide to throw calories out the window, have one each.
