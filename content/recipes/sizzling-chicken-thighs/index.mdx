<Ingredients>

### Ingredients
    
  - 4 medium chicken thighs (boneless and skinless)
  - 2 tbsp lard
  - 1 tsp salt
  - 1/2 tsp black pepper

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation
  - Remove the chicken from the fridge about half an hour before cooking to warm up.

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Dry the chicken thighs with kitchen towel.
    - Rub the thighs with the salt and pepper.
  - **Step 2**
    - Melt the lard in a frying pan on a high heat. (I use number 8.)
  - **Step 3**
    - Once the lard is melted, place the chicken thighs into the frying pan.
    - Fry for 10-15 mins, turn the thighs over part way through.
    - Make sure the juices of the chicken are running clear or a meat thermometer reads 75 deg C or 165 deg F. If not return the chicken to the pan for longer.
  - **Step 4**
    - Serve.

</Instructions>
