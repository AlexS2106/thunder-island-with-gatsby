I remember back before I first started cooking, I mean when I really started cooking with ‘from scratch’ ingredients and not unpackaging things before putting them in the oven, that for a long time, I was a little intimidated by the 'big' meats.  Pork shanks, lamb shanks, French rack of ribs, basically anything which had an animal part shape.  If it wasn’t an oval slab of meat, I avoided buying it. Now, if it’s new, if it’s cheap, I buy it and try it.

If this reminds you of you, then let me share a secret with you.  Take a big meat, any big meat, and it will be three hours at 150 deg C.  Take a small meat, any small meat, and it will be 20 mins at 200 deg C. Omg! Did I just say that? Yes, I did! The secret is out! The magic of cooking has gone – poof!

Seriously, it's always the same. These two rules are the golden ratios of meat cooking timings. Follow these rules, and you will almost (make a point of the almost, because for every rule there’s an exception) never go wrong.
