<Ingredients>

### Ingredients
    
  - 2x 750g (1.5lb) pork shanks, bone
  - ½ tbsp lard
  - ½ tsp salt
  - ½ beef stock cube
  - ½ cup water

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Preheat a fan-assisted oven to 150°C (or 300°F).
  - **Step 2**
    - Dry both pork shanks with kitchen paper.
    - Rub all sides of both pork shanks with salt.
  - **Step 3**
    - Melt the lard in a frying pan on the hob on the highest heat.
    - When the lard is shimmering, add the pork shanks.
    - Brown the pork on all sides; you might need to hold it in place with some tongs.
  - **Step 4**
    - Place each browned pork shank into the baking tray.
    - Remove the entire frying pan from the hob and let the pan cool a bit.
    - Add the water and the beef stock to the frying pan and use them to scrape any brown bits from the bottom of the pan. The residual heat should also melt the stock cube.
    - Add the stock mix from the frying pan to the baking tray.
    - Cover the tray with aluminium foil sealing it tightly on all sides of the tray.
  - **Step 5**
    - Cook in the oven for 3 hours undisturbed.
  - **Step 6**
    - Serve with the juices.

Before I first started cooking, I mean before I really started cooking with actual ingredients instead of unpackaging things and putting them in the oven, I was too intimidated to cook the 'big' meats. Pork shanks, lamb shanks, French rack of ribs, if it wasn't an oval slab of meat, I avoided buying it. Nowadays, it's budget over everything else; if it's cheap, I buy it and try it.

Let me share a secret with you take a big lump of meat, any meat, and it will be soft and juicy after three hours at 150 deg C.  Take a small lump of meat, any meat, and it will be 20 mins at 200 deg C. Omg! Did I just say that? Yes, I did! The secret is out! The magic of cooking has gone – poof!

Seriously, it's always the same. These two rules are the golden ratios of meat cooking timings. Follow these rules, and you will almost (make a point of the almost, because for every rule there's an exception) never go wrong.
