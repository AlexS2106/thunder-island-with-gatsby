Sometimes, you just want something sweet! Enter banana squares! More senior family members aren’t too fond of it – apparently, “warm bananas just aren’t right”. I love them, so I guess the success of Banana Squares all depends on whether you like warm bananas or not.

Want to know about the history of the Gros Michel banana? No? Well, fear not, for I shall inform you anyway but in a humorous and sarcastic way, or you can skip my waffling and head to the recipe itself.

Did you know the bananas we eat now are not the bananas we used to eat? Shock, horror!  They sneaked that one past us all, didn’t they? So, let me un-sneak the whole sordid affair, just for the purposes of entertainment through a blog post, and tell you how big Michael drooped…

We beings of the human race, who, of sound mind and body, are quite prepared to consign ourselves to oblivion in our ongoing quest to destroy the planet we live on, decided in our wisdom to refine the world’s bananas down to just one type.  Obviously, it was the tastiest type, and its name was… the Gros Michel.  

The big Michael.  Such an interesting name for a banana, don’t you think?  Let us ponder for a moment on the phallic nature of the banana and bet if it was a man or a woman who thought that name up?  One also wonders what, precisely, were they doing at the time?  

Apparently, the wishy-washy bananas of today cannot even compare to the banana-ery tastiness of the Gros Michel.  It was such a delicious banana that’s all we ate, and that’s all that was planted. Field after field of Gros Michel banana trees.

Delicious years pass by, and the banana industry is booming. Money, money everywhere! The wonder that is nature, who loves diversity and survival of the fittest, turned its attention to these lie after like banana trees with identical bananas and laughed. Mwahahaaaa!  

Up pops a little fungus, and what does it like to eat more than anything else? Yep, you guessed it – delicious Gros Michel banana trees. It starts to munch, and it’s got fields and fields and fields of fungal heaven. The banana trees, though, they get sick, like super sick. The Big Michaels start drooping. No more banana trees meant no more tasty bananas. 

What to do? What to do? Think fast! Over in little old England, there was another banana. It was not so tasty, not so great, but it was a banana at least! It was... The Cavendish. Such a very austere, English-type name, don’t you think? We English are good at naming stuff – Cock Alley, Titty-Ho, the River Piddle. See what I mean? 

“We are saved! We are saved!” Say the banana growers of the world. There was a mad rush. Human versus fungus! People went bananas planting Cavendish bananas trees, and said a sad goodbye to the Gros Michel. People still have bananas to eat. Yippee!!

Ah! But, who has the power in the war between humans and nature? Because, my dear banana students, that is not the end of my story. No, no, no! You see, without the Gros Michel to feed on, our little fungus also turned to alternatives, and, you guessed it, it quite likes the Cavendish. Makes you wonder what bananas we will have in a few more years, perhaps none at all.  A world without bananas would be a world without banana quiche or even, shock-horror, banoffee pie!
