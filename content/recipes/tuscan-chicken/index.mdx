## Making Your Very Own Sun-Dried Tomatoes

The make-you-own method of obtaining some sun-dried tomatoes takes a while, but is a sure way to a purer, more health-friendly ingredient.

<Ingredients>

### Ingredients

  - 400 g (2 cups) cherry tomatoes
  - pinch of salt

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

  - Cut the cherry tomatoes in half.
 
#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Preheat a fan-assisted oven to 110deg C (230 deg F).
  - **Step 2** 
    - Line a baking tray with baking paper.
    - Place the cherry tomatoes cut side upwards on the baking paper.
    - Sprinkle the tomatoes with the salt.
  - **Step 3** 
    - Place the tray in the center of the oven.
    - Leave to cook for 3 hours. 
    - Check occasionally from about 2 hours onwards to ensure the tomatoes are not burning.

</Instructions>

##### Notes

When the sun-dried tomatoes are cool and if you are not using them straight away, store them covered in olive oil. 
Even if you want to use them straight away adding a tablespoon of olive oil moistens and improves their taste.
