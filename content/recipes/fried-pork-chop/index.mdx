<Ingredients>

### Ingredients
    
  - 2x thin cut (3oz or 85g) bone-in pork chops 
  - 3 tbsp lard
  - ½ tsp salt
  - ½ tsp black pepper
  - ½ tsp sweet paprika
  - ½ tsp curry powder

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

  - Remove the pork chops from the fridge about 15 minutes before cooking, so they warm up to room temperature before cooking.

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Melt the lard in a medium sized frying pan over a medium-high heat. (I use number 7.)
  - **Step 2**
    - Mix the salt, pepper, paprika and curry powder.
    - Rub the spice mix on both sides of the pork chops.
  - **Step 3**
    - When the lard is sizzling, add both pork chops to the pan.
    - Fry the pork chops for 3 minutes on one side, flip them over and fry for 2 minutes on the other side. Remove if the juices run clear.
    - A meat thermometer should read 62°C (or 145°F).
  - **Step 4**
    - Wrap the cooked pork chops in aluminium foil and leave for 5 minutes.
  - **Step 5**
    - Serve.

</Instructions>
