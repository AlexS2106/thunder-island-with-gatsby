<Ingredients>

### Ingredients
    
  - 1x whole chicken without giblets
  - 2 tbsp ghee or butter

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

  - Remove the chicken from the fridge 1 hour before cooking.
  - Calculate the chicken cooking time.
    - 20 mins each for every 450g or 1 lb.
    - Also, add an extra 20 mins on top.

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Preheat a fan-assisted oven to 200 deg C or 400 deg F.
  - **Step 2**
    - Place a roasting tray in the oven with the butter for 5 mins.
    - Remove the roasting tray from the oven.
    - Place the chicken on the roasting tray breast side up.
    - Spoon the now melted butter over the chicken, make sure it's completely covered.
    - Place the chicken back in the oven.
  - **Step 3**
    - Set the timer for the calculated time (see preparation).
  - **Step 4**
    - Baste in the middle of cooking if you wish, don't, if you don't want to bother. The difference between doing and not doing isn't so much.
  - **Step 5**
    - When the timer sounds, remove chicken out of the oven. 
    - It's cooked if the juices run clear, to be sure use a meat thermometer.
    - Keep the juices left in the pan, they are completely delicious when added into gravy.
    - Wrap the chicken in a couple of layers of aluminium foil and leave it for 20 mins.
  - **Step 6**
    - Unwrap, cut and serve.
