Almond flour chia bread is soft, filling, and really delicious. 

While I was considering a label for this bread, I went through numerous names trying to give an instant idea of where this recipe would be most beneficial.  Basket bread, paleo aside bread, chia seed soup bread…  None of these names made the cut, but you can see where my ideas were.  This bread will stretch to being covered in some spread for a morning breakfast or as a quick snack when you feel a little hungry.  But, for holding a burger together, or as the ending to a loaded sandwich, I think better alternatives are around.  Ideally, this bread, in my humble opinion, is the absolute best choice for dipping in soup or laid out in a basket as an extra side for dinner.  

This bread is a small loaf yet substantial enough between two people. The addition of chia seeds and their whopping amount of fibre make you feel full on a small amount without detracting from the taste or adding to the net carbs. 

When making this bread, one area of difficulty is pouring the bread batter into the bread tin. I saw once where the author of wholesomeyum had a nifty idea and held the baking paper apart with pegs which works well. Just remember to remove those pegs before you place the bread in the oven.  If you use plastic ones and forget to remove them, then, 45 minutes later, you have to bin your bread and spend a lot of time scraping plastic from everywhere it dripped around the oven.  Another option to using pegs is to use an extra pair of hands to hold back the paper for you. With the current lockdown in Malta, I have two tiny helpers on-hand/underfoot. This works just as well as using pegs, but with a lot of giggling and the added bonus of a proud “I helped Mummy” this soup may have, well, everyone did recover from their colds - eventually.
