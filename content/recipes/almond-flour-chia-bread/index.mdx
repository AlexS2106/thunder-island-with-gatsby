Almond flour chia bread is soft, filling, delicious and the absolute winner for a bit o' soup dipping. Adding chia seeds and their whopping amount of fibre make you feel full on a small amount without detracting from the taste or adding to the net carbs. This particular recipe makes a small loaf, which is an excellent side dish for four or, even better, divide it into two to soup dip. 

While considering a label for this bread, I went through numerous names to give an instant idea of where this recipe would be most beneficial: basket bread, paleo aside-bread, chia seed soup bread. None of these names made it, but you can see where my ideas were. Despite the naming brainstorm, don't discount covering this bread with some spread for breakfast or a quick snack when you feel a little hungry. Where it does fail, however, is for holding a burger together or as endings to a loaded sandwich - I think there are better alternatives around. 

The one difficulty I had when making this bread was pouring the bread batter into the tin. I saw once where the author of 'wholesomeyum' had a nifty idea and held the baking paper apart with pegs. From my own very personal experience, this method works well, but if you forget to remove those pegs before you place the bread in the oven 45 minutes later, you have to bin your bread and spend a lot of time scraping plastic from the oven. Grrr!
