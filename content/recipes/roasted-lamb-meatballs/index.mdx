<Ingredients>

### Ingredients
    
  - 500 g lamb mince (1lb)
  - 60 g fennel (about 2oz or a quarter of a fennel)
  - 1/2 tbsp dried parsley
  - 1/2 tsp salt
  - 1/2 tsp black pepper
  - 1/8 tsp ground cinnamon
  - 1/8 tsp allspice

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Preparation

  - Finely shred the fennel (I use the food processor here.)

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Preheat a fan-assisted oven to 200 deg C or 400 deg F.
  - **Step 2**
    - Soften the fennel by cooking on full for 1 minute in the microwave.
  - **Step 3**
    - Mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl, including the softened fennel.
  - **Step 4**
    - Line a baking tray with baking paper.
    - Squish the mixture through your fingers until the texture is smooth. This is important because, without the squishing, your meatballs will not stick together.
    - Shape the mixture into about 15-20 small balls and place them on the baking paper.Make sure each meatball has space on all sides.
    - Oven bake for 25 mins turning the meatballs halfway through.
  - **Step 5**
    - Serve.
