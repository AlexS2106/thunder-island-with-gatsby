For those who lack enthusiasm in the kitchen, read here first! You are about to see a long list of ingredients for Sea Bream with Grape Salad and think, “Urgh! This is just far too much effort for me.” Let me tell you straight off to try to keep you here – it really isn’t! 

There are a few veggies to chop, you need to put a couple of fish in the oven, and that’s it. Prepare the fish and put them in the oven; while they cook, start the salad and ready the vinaigrette. By the time the fish are cooked just 30 minutes later, you’re all ready. This is minimal effort and time, but boy, does it impress!  Friends, loved ones, and family members, the adult ones anyway, because the kids aren’t fooled when you tell them it’s like fish fingers and fruit. “It looks at me!” and “There’s green in it!” they say, utterly convinced you are attempting to poison them with those healthy, natural ingredients. 

This recipe has been ready for posting for some time now, but I posted a sea bream recipe only last week, and so this one has been ‘on hold’ until a suitable amount of time has passed.  Now that that time is done let’s talk about sea bream.

The sea bream is a fearsome-looking fish with a row of spikes running down its back and an impressive artillery of sharp teeth inside its mouth.  Cook it up, however, and it has a very delicate-looking white flesh inside. This flesh is, arguably, the tastiest in the water world. 

As one of the most abundant and cheapest fish farmed from Maltese waters, sea bream is ideal for me to experiment with. In all honesty, it’s hard to go wrong with this particular fish; even the most failed recipe experiment tastes good. 

Sea bream appear in Maltese shops, either wild-caught or farmed. Just off-shore, there are a good number of fish farms all around the island. These farms are hotly contested.  Many Maltese claim they pollute the waters of the Mediterranean. That licenses to keep them go to ‘friends of friends’, and no one is ever held accountable for the pollution, nor is it corrected. 

Early in 2019, there was the ‘biblical flying fish’ incident when a big storm swept across Malta and its surrounding waters. Fish from one of the farms in the Southern part of the island were swept out of the nets. These poor fish were then thrown through the air by the storm’s force and deposited on land. Despite warnings, many residents went on fish collecting expeditions. Fish became the dish of the day in many a household for some time afterwards. In case you are wondering, that is not where I got mine! 

Luckily for me, here in the EU, all labels must declare where the fish was sourced. This makes the paleo lifestyle preference for wild-caught fish a lot easier to accomplish – at least in this particular area.  Grass-fed beef, I might point out, is almost an impossibility!  One of the reasons for a paleo-ish section on this site is because, very soon upon embarking on the paleo diet, I found that not everything can be as we wish in the quest for ultimate health.  Sometimes, we just have to do the best we can.

If you want to have plain salted sea bream, just follow that part of the recipe and omit the salad and vinaigrette. However, I recommend you try the whole recipe as is at least once. It really is a delicious salad, and all the ingredients are easy to acquire and easy to prep.
