### Instructions

#### Preparation

  - Remove the beef from the fridge 30 minutes before to cookng to warm up.

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Turn the slow cooker onto low.
    - Mix the salt, pepper and almond flour for the filling on a plate. 
    - Add the beef and toss, covering the beef on all sides.
  - **Step 2**
    - Melt the lard on a high heat in a medium sized frying pan. (I use number 8.)
    - When the lard shimmers, brown the beef on all sides, about 1 minute.
    - Remove the beef with a slotted spoon and place in the slow cooker.
  - **Step 3**
    - Lower the heat down to medium. (I use number 6) 
    - Fry the onions until translucent, about 3 minutes.
    - Remove the onions with a slotted spoon and add to the slow cooker.
  - **Step 4**
    - Remove the frying pan from the hob, and wait for it to cool.
    - Add the beef stock to the pan and scrape around the bottom of the pan to get all the brown bits up.
    - Pour the beef stock into the slow cooker.
  - **Step 5**
    - Add the dried sage, thyme, tarragon and parsley to the slow cooker.
    - Stir the ingredients well.
  - **Step 6**
    - Leave to slow cook for 6 hours.
  - **Step 7**
    - To make the pastry, mix all the pastry ingredients in a bowl.
    - Roll the pastry out into the approximate shape of a 23cm x 23cm (or 9x9inch) dish, measure it to your dish if you need to.
    - Cut the pastry into quarters.
  - **Step 8**
    - Preheat a fan-assisted oven to 180deg C or 375 deg F.
  - **Step 9**
    - Remove the cooked beef and onion from the slow cooker with a slotted spoon and place in the pie/casserole dish.
    - Scoop out 120ml (½ cup) of the stock left in the bottom and add to the dish as well. 
    - Leave the rest of the stock in the slow cooker on warm and cover.
    - Use a fish slice to move each piece of pastry over to the pie dish. 
    - Place the pastry on top to cover all the meat. 
    - Cut away any excess pastry and use it to fill any holes you may have.
    - Use a pastry brush and brush the ½tsp of ghee over the top of the pastry.
  - **Step 10**
    - Bake in the oven for 30 mins.
  - **Step 11**
    - Serve the pie with the stock that was left in the slow cooker as a gravy.
