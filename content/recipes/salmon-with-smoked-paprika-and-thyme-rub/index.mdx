Seared Salmon with Smoked Paprika and Thyme is another simple salmon herb/spice variation – simply because one can never have enough! It’s easy to underestimate the importance of herbs and spices, but they give a completely different taste for minimal effort, and dried herbs and spices are cheap as cheap can be. 

A dill flavoured salmon or paprika flavoured one?  Garlic or pepper. Hot and spicy or cool and mellow? See what I mean? For the sake of a few tubs on the shelf, you too can have insane dinner options!

This recipe is here because not everyone has a smokehouse outback. We of the apartment buildings on small islands have to improvise and fake it. Those of us who are paleo have to do this without the fake stuff from the shelf!

Smoked paprika gives the salmon an as close to smokey flavour as we will get. The searing brings this out a little bit more while thyme gives it an additional woody tone.

Anyone who has read previous posts will know I‘m not the biggest fan of fish dinners; too many bones and too much hassle for the end result.  However, my husband likes fish occasionally while my mum is a fanatic and my eldest daughter loved salmon right from her first few teeth. Yep, I have a Daddy’s girl right here! Therefore, every now and again, I feel guilty and decide we aren’t eating enough fish – because we don’t and should definitely eat more. It’s healthy right, we’ve got to eat it? So, armed with Mummy/wifey guilt, I pop off to buy something… inspiring. Usually returning with sea bream or salmon.  The salmon works out the best. I can buy it as a fillet without bones, and salmon is hard to mess up.
