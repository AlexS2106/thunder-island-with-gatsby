<Ingredients>

### Ingredients
  
  - 2 x lamb hindshanks
  - 1 tsp salt
  - 1 tsp lard
  - 2 cups lamb stock
  - 1 tsp marjoram
  - 1 tsp sage
  - 1 tsp coriander

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>

### Instructions

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Preheat the oven to 150 deg C or 300 deg F.
  - **Step 2**
    - Pat dry the lamb hindshanks.
    - Rub the salt on all sides.
  - **Step 3**
    - Melt the lard in a large pan on the hob.
    - Sear all sides of both the lamb hindshanks to brown. You might need to hold the hindshanks in place to get them browned on all the sides.
    - Remove the hindshanks and set them aside.
  - **Step 4**
    - Let the frying pan cool a little.
    - Pour the lamb stock into the pan and use a fish slice to scrape off any browned bits stuck to the bottom.
    - Scrape the lamb stock from the frying pan into a baking tray with high sides.
    - Add the browned shanks to the baking tray.
    - Sprinkle the marjoram, sage and coriander over the hindshanks.
    - Cover the baking tray with aluminium foil. Try to make it a closed environment with no holes, and tented so the foil doesn't touch the shanks.
  - **Step 5**
    - Roast for 3 hours undisturbed.
  - **Step 6**
    - Serve with the juices as a gravy.
