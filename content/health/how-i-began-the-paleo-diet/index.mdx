Hi! 

If you don’t know, already I am Alex, owner and writer of this website. I have a long and complex history of health problems that have been essentially cured by the paleo diet. I cover this in other articles in the interest of sharing and in the sincere hopes of helping others. However, this post is about how I began the paleo diet, which incidentally had nothing at all to do with digestive health and everything to do with weight loss.

So… how did this paleo thing happen for me?  Two children and a husband. 

I had my first child, and like many women, there was a certain ’roundedness’, shall we say, involved in the happy occasion that I was not quite so delighted with. The weight had to go!
Believe it or not, I had never dieted previously. However, over 19 years together, I had seen my husband struggle through various diets and ultimately fail on each one. Some of these had more of an effect prior to failure than others.
His best and fastest record of weight loss had come from the Atkins diet, which, for those unaware, was a strict low-carb diet highly popular a few years ago. But, I had also seen him fail because of the strictness of the diet and knew I had to find an alternative.

An hour of research later, I made a proclamation. “I am going on the paleo diet.”

This was, I felt at the time, a significant statement. It was met with “okay”. A man of many a prophetic word, my husband.

My choice of the paleo diet was primarily to do with the 80/20 rule. It said that if I was 80% good, I could be 20% bad, thus allowing the leeway that caused my husband’s failure on the Atkins diet. Or, what it really meant was that I could still have an occasional snickers bar!
Filled with joy over my soon-to-arrive success, I looked for my first meal; another hour later, I was, I admit, a bit huffy. Almond flour? Coconut flour? Amino acids? Ghee? Who has these? Or, more appropriately, what are these? I actually did have to look them up on the internet. While the descriptions made things a bit clearer, hope remained elusive. I live on a small island, and we get basic items. They were, at the time anyway, highly specialised culinary ingredients.
Wading through a mountainous number of recipes, some a bit more ‘paleo’ than others, I found a few I knew I could get the ingredients for and hopefully make with my limited cooking expertise. It was a beginning.  

Over the following weeks, I managed to arrange some sort of schedule.

The baby slept, I found a recipe. 

The baby woke, we went to the shop armed with a shopping list.

The baby slept, I cut vegetables.

The baby woke, I stopped.

The baby slept; I prepared a bit more.

The baby woke, I stopped.      

The baby slept, the baby woke, the baby slept, the baby woke, the baby slept…  

The meal was ready, and… yes, the baby woke… 

We had a lot of burnt or cold meals – that was the baby. We had a lot of lousy tasting meals – that was me.  

Time progressed, and the baby gained more of a routine, the meals improved, and I lost the weight.

My husband, at some point, joined me. Whether this was the result of having to cook his own meals otherwise, or because he reached a point of overweight that was just ‘too much’ and decided to take advantage of having diet meals cooked for him, I’m not sure.     

The paleo diet worked for him as well.   

I reached my goal weight… Yay, go me!!!

Even after reaching my goal weight, I continued with the paleo diet.  The health benefits I felt while on it I just couldn’t ignore. For reference, if you have an interest, visit thepaleodiet.com for more scientific information.
Fast forward a couple of years to another pregnancy. In that time we had good meals and bad. ‘The good’ found their way into a rollerdex I bought especially for the purpose, ‘the bad’ got cleared from my browser history, and the ‘okay but could do with something more’ got scribbled onto my recipe paper pad to get worked on. Anything with an alternative flour or amino acids got passed over as soon as I saw them in the ingredient list. I didn’t have those ingredients, and I couldn’t get them. 

I discovered that a paleo diet recipe doesn’t mean it will help with weight loss rather that it roughly follows the ‘lifestyle’ guidelines. Those who need to lose weight, beware!

I learned how to substitute things; most ‘normal’ recipes can be made paleo with a bit of a chop and change.  

My husband plateaued before reaching his goal weight.

On further research, we substituted fennel for onions in recipes due to the carb content of onions. If you wish, you can directly switch them back at a ratio of 1:1. However, onions come with their own health problems, so you might find fennel a better alternative – my mum did. I dropped out carrots from most recipes for the same reasons, and I limited recipes with honey to one every other week.

His weight loss restarted, and he attained his goal weight. Yay to hubby!

Baby number two arrived, so did a second occurrence of ’roundedness’. It had to go! The time to spend at a kitchen counter…
Well, that also… went…

Now, a few years later, we have a list of easy-to-make, paleo inspired recipes with easy to acquire ingredients written on a dinosaur stickered laptop. My eldest likes stickers and is in a  dinosaur phase.
