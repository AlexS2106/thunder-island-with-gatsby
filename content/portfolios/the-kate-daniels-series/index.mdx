<div className="body">

About this series - I bought one book after another and, at the end of the series of ten, I wished there were more.

These books are exactly what they are supposed to be. It’s a young adult urban fantasy series that entertains. If you want an epic fantasy series with incredible world-building, better try The Wheel of Time. If you want a moral ending that might possibly right the wrongs of the world, try The Lord of the Rings. However, if you want a book series for pure entertainment value, then this will fit the bill – perfectly!

Good looking heroine but not too good looking? Check! A heroine we like? Check. Kickass? Check! Witty? Check! Strong-willed? Check! A few appealing flaws? Check! Now for the hero. Let’s see… Good looking? Check! Manly? Check! A good match for our heroine? Check! Adores the heroine we are now convinced is perfect in every way? Check! A meeting which, after some trials and tribulations, sees them getting together for a long-anticipated smooch? A few more trials and tribulations from outside sources set on their destruction? They come through it to be better and stronger than ever before? Nope, not telling you!

The Kate Daniels series is set in Atlanta, America. While I implied previously that you should look elsewhere to find incredible world-building, this is not strictly true. There isn’t a complex map or new lands; instead, the authors have dreamt up an alternative reality to the world we know in a really unique way. Something I think is tough to do these days. In Kate Daniels’ World, magic is coming back while the non-magic world fights to remain.

Each book in the series contains a story unto itself and places Kate into different situations she has to resolve, from an unkillable being to a plague-wielding goddess. However, each book advances Kate’s relationships with those around her, pushes her life and lifestyle forward, and moves the underlying plot of the showdown between Kate and her ultimate arch-nemesis towards its inevitable conclusion. So, while you could read them out of order, I would say, “Don’t do it!”. Read the books in order, it will be money and time enjoyably spent.

The Kate Daniels Series consists of these ten books. Here they are, in order, to make life easier.

    Magic Bites
    Magic Burns
    Magic Strikes
    Magic Bleeds
    Magic Slays
    Magic rises
    Magic Breaks
    Magic Shifts
    Magic Binds
    Magic Triumphs

There are also a few spin-offs and the spawning of a new series starring a couple of the secondary characters.
Enjoy!
