excerpt: How not to make dinosaur eggs and the loss of Brontosaurus.
---

<WritingBody>

Like most parents, I am filled with good intentions to regularly provide fun activities that prove to be both stimulating and educational. These marvellous activities will result in industrious and happy small persons. Yeah, right... I keep dreaming!

My eldest child, Isla, went through a dinosaur phase. Fun activity dreamed up by one over-zealous Mummy? Paper-mache dinosaur eggs. 

Had I known what would happen, I'd have told myself not to be such an idiot. Instead, I embarked enthusiastically on a rosy-eyed vision of a journey of childish industriousness. 

My problems began almost immediately. I don't know how to make paper mache. I'm sure at one point, possibly many points in my childhood, I had 'paper-mached' various projects. But, try as I might, I couldn't remember the ingredients. 

I remain undaunted. Not a problem, merely a minor hic-cup. I can google! 

The ingredients for paper mache: 1 cup of water and 1 cup of flour. The method: Mix together and use. 

Well, that sounds easy enough. 

I am not a regular baker, however. I check my almost non-existent baking stock and discover some elderly gluten-free flour. The reason for its presence within my kitchen had been lost with time, but at least I have flour.

The thought flashes through my brain; will gluten-free flour work? Is gluten important? I google! Unfortunately, I failed to discover a straightforward answer on the matter but was left with the distinct impression it wouldn't. Gluten, it seems, is sticky; it is what makes flour stick. Without gluten, there is no stickiness; without stickiness, there are disintegrated dinosaur eggs. 

I go to the shops and buy regular flour with everything present and accounted for; gluten stickiness at the ready. I also buy a couple of Malta's daily papers for the first time since moving to Malta.

With the practical side sorted, I turn to the academic side of this activity.

So that my four-year-old daughter could write her ground-breaking PhD dissertation immediately afterwards, I began googling the necessary prehistoric information to ensure all facts I was about to pass along were correct. 

I began by choosing three dinosaurs: Brontosaurus, Tyrannosaurus Rex, and Stegosaurus. I considered these three among the most well-known dinosaurs, and, as my daughter already had a toy representing each one, I felt assured these were good choices. Let's get that pin ready to burst my little bubble!  

Brontosaurus doesn't exist.

I couldn't believe it either!

Brontosaurus doesn't exist!

I had to repeat it just to believe it!

Suppose you, like me, grew up believing Brontosaurus was the largest dinosaur to have ever existed. In that case, you can understand my confusion, but you read me right, Brontosaurus does not exist! It is really quite upsetting. I can only liken the feeling to when Pluto was removed from the list of planets. How dare they declare Pluto *'unplaneted'*! How dare they remove Brontosaurus from the list of dinosaurs! 

Incensed with the injustice of the world, I google to uncover the facts and uncover the whole sordid story. Someone found part of a skeleton. As quickly as they could, this person registered it as a new dinosaur find. Proudly, they endow it with the name Apatosaurus. Fast forward a few years, another person makes their own incredible find. A really, really big dinosaur skeleton! They, too, run off to register the new discovery. They name it Brontosaurus. These discoverers relax; their places in the history of the world as finders and namers of gigantic dinosaurs are assured. They sit back and relax. And, for many a year, there have been two separate and distinct dinosaurs. One is called Apatosaurus, and the other is Brontosaurus. 

Now, for whatever reason, Apatosaurus fades into the background. Brontosaurus, on the other hand, becomes a film star! We all learn about it in school. It's the biggest land animal to have ever been! It gets its own replicas! Lots of them! Brontosaurus made it! Brontosaurus is famous! Everybody loves Brontosaurus.

Let's move along a few more years. Palaeontologists, who, you must remember, also know the name of the otherwise forgotten Apatosaurus, keep eyeing Brontosaurus suspiciously. 'Ah-ha!' they conclude. 'This is the same dinosaur!' It's the death knell of the Brontosaurus we are so fond of. Enter the funeral march of Brontosaurus here… dum dum dee dum, dum dee dum dee dum dee dum…

Faced with two names, Brontosaurus, known by almost the entire world and the other, Apatosaurus, which hardly anyone has heard of, you would think the only sensible solution would be to drop the unknown name and keep the known one. This would save schools and other educational institutions worldwide millions on books. This would prevent significant confusion. And those who, having already been robbed of the smallest of the planets in our solar system (oh, Pluto, where art thou!), would not be further traumatised by the disappearance of the much-beloved dinosaur they had grown up with. This perfectly logical solution would have been too easy! Unfortunately, this is not so! To resolve such conflicts and prevent archaeological fisticuffs, the first name stands while the second is resigned to the bin. Sensible be damned! And so, unbeknownst to me and many others, Apatosaurus had won, Brontosaurus had lost. However, the scientific institutions must have learnt from the highly publicised demotion of Pluto, which sparked protests, outright denials and social media groups. They kept it all out of the spotlight and gave the mightiest of my childhood dinosaurs to the nether realm of unexistence. 

After the traumatic loss of Brontosaurus, I pull myself together. Parenthood must go on!

A short google later, I know everything there is to know about Apatosaurus' egg size, most likely dietary requirements and the adult size of 22 meters. The eggs and diet are straightforward, the size... not so much. Are the 22 meters from nose to tail on a diagonal or along the ground while the dinosaur is standing? Never mind, I think. What are a few metres here and there? Isla's dissertation devolves from a PhD to Masters.

Now for T-Rex…

Tyrannosaurus Rex? Possibly, the most famous dinosaur of all time? Star of countless movies? Apparently, it's one of the rarest dinosaurs to find, and there are no complete skeletons found as yet. The best the experts have is 90% of it. And, there have been no T-Rex eggs found, ever! Experts don't even want to guesstimate the egg size… The best I could do after much fruitless googling, which started to make me googly-eyed, was one expert saying they suspected a T-Rex egg was between the size of a penguin egg and an ostrich; possibly closer to the penguin egg. I've only made an omelette with chicken eggs. What size is a penguin egg? Undeterred! I google! It seems I completely underestimated the variety of penguins out there. There are 17 different species of penguins of varying sizes with, obviously, a variety of different-sized eggs. My expert obviously cheated me in his T-Rex egg guesstimate. I googled ostrich eggs instead and shaved a bit off the length. My daughter will never know… The dissertation is now at Batchelors level.

Stegosaurus, thankfully, was easy as! The palaeontologists had taken pity on me.

Now, how do you simultaneously blow up a balloon and measure it with a tape measure? You can't. Instead, you must enlist(erm…force) a nearby husband into your madcap scheme. My husband held and puffed while I watched and measured. Make what you will of that particular sentence.

Ready and waiting for 'paper-macheing', the T-Rex egg balloon had suffered a puncture. The King of the dinosaurs was a frazzled bit of rubber measuring less than a centimetre beside the proudly puffed Apatosaurus and Stegosaurus. We hastily found another balloon, hubby puffed, and I measured. 

Everything was ready! I explained the fun activity, and my daughter ran away to hide in her tent. Apparently, the paper mache would make her messy, and she was wearing a pretty dress! No amount of cajoling would bring her out of the tent. A pretty dress, especially one which was pink and swished from side to side when she wiggled, trumped 'fun activity' in her opinion.

My husband 'paper-mached' Stegosaurus and Apatosaurus, and I 'paper-mached' T-Rex. My husband and I found the exercise quite relaxing and therapeutic.
 
It took a day for the paper mache eggs to dry out and the pretty dress to be placed in the wash, and then the eggs were painted in their own unique colours. Apatosaurus got blue, T-Rex got brown, and Stegosaurus was declared green. Apparently, Apatosaurus eggs also have stickers on them. Since the experts can't even guess the egg size, who are they to tell us no? 

When the paper mache dried, we popped the inner balloons with gusto. Destruction of any object (as long as it isn't a pretty dress) is always met with immediate enthusiasm. Should I be worried?

Each egg also hatched. My husband spontaneously initiated this unplanned event with a pair of scissors, which delighted our daughter. She then coaxed them out of their eggs and painted each one a plate of food. T-Rex got meat (red and brown paint swirls), Apatosaurus got tree branches (green paint swirls), Stegosaurus got plants and flowers (green paint swirls with pink blobs). 

My next plan was to go out somewhere more spacious than our apartment. A 22-metre Apatosaurus was never going to fit…

Unfortunately, fate chose otherwise. That morning we dropped my son off at nursery, only for him to be sent home again within the hour. What we thought was a mosquito bite was the start of chickenpox, and we weren't going anywhere for two weeks. Instead, we measured the slightly smaller T-Rex and Stegosaurus in the longest part of our home, the corridor. My husband held one end of the tape measure, and my daughter and I took the other. We tried to measure a Stegosaurus. Unfortunately, whoever made our tape measure had not considered the need to measure dinosaurs - the tape measure wasn't long enough. Undeterred, we tag-teamed the length and found Stegosaurus was about 12 daughters long while T-Rex was between two and three husbands tall.
