excerpt: How not to make dinosaur eggs and the loss of Brontosaurus.
---

<WritingBody>

Like most parents, I am filled with good intentions to regularly provide fun activities that prove to be both stimulating and educational. These marvellous activities will result in industrious and happy small persons. Yeah, right... I keep dreaming!

My eldest child, Isla, went through a dinosaur phase. Fun activity dreamed up by one over-zealous Mummy? Paper-mache dinosaur eggs. 

Had I known what would happen, I’d have told myself not to be such an idiot. Instead, I embarked with much enthusiasm on a rosy-eyed vision of a journey of childish industriousness. 

My problems began almost immediately. I don’t know how to make paper-mache. I’m sure at one point, possibly many points in my childhood, I had paper-mached various projects. But, try as I might, I couldn’t remember the ingredients. 

I remain undaunted. Not a problem, merely a minor hic-cup, I can google! 

Ingredients for paper-mache: 1 cup of water, 1 cup of flour. Method: Mix it together and use.  Well, that sounds easy enough. 
I am not a regular baker. I check my almost non-existent baking stock and discover some elderly gluten-free flour. The reason for its presence within my kitchen had been lost with time, but at least I have some flour.

The thought flashes through my brain; will gluten-free flour work? Is the gluten important?
I google!

Unfortunately, I failed to discover a straightforward answer on the matter but was left with the distinct impression it wouldn’t. Gluten, it seems, is sticky; it is what makes flour stick. Without gluten, there is no stickiness, and without stickiness, there are disintegrated dinosaur eggs. Just to be sure, I pop off to the shops and buy regular flour with everything present and accounted for; gluten stickiness at the ready. I also buy a couple of Malta’s daily papers for the first time in over ten years of living in Malta.

With the practical side sorted, I turn to the academic side of this activity.

So that my 4-year-old daughter would be capable of write her ground-breaking PhD dissertation immediately afterwards, I set to work googling the necessary prehistoric information to ensure all facts I was about to pass along were correct. 

I began by choosing three dinosaurs: Brontosaurus, Tyrannosaurus Rex, and Stegosaurus, which I considered among the most well-known dinosaurs. As my daughter already had a toy representing each one, I felt assured of my own fabulousness that these were good choices. Let’s get that pin ready to burst my little bubble!  

Brontosaurus doesn’t exist.

I couldn’t believe it either!

Brontosaurus doesn’t exist!

I had to repeat it just to believe it!

If you, like me, grew up believing Brontosaurus was the largest dinosaur to have ever existed, you can understand my confusion, but you read me right, Brontosaurus does not exist! It is really quite upsetting. I can only liken the feeling to when Pluto was removed from the list of planets. How dare they declare Pluto, not a planet! How dare they remove Brontosaurus from the list of dinosaurs! Incensed with the injustice of the world, I google to uncover the facts and uncover the whole sordid story. 

Someone found part of a skeleton. This person ran, quick as they could, to register it as a new dinosaur find. Proudly, they endow it with the name Apatosaurus. Fast forward a few years, another person makes their own incredible find. A really, really big dinosaur skeleton! They, too, run off to register the new discovery. They name it Brontosaurus. These discoverers relax. Both are firmly under the impression their places in the history of the world as finders and namers of gigantic dinosaurs are assured. They sit back. They relax. And, for many a year, there are two separate and distinct dinosaurs. One is called Apatosaurus, and another is called Brontosaurus. 

Now, for whatever reason, Apatosaurus fades into the background. Brontosaurus, on the other hand, becomes a film star! We all learn about it in school. It’s the biggest land animal to have ever been! It gets its own replicas! Lots of them! Brontosaurus made it! Brontosaurus is famous! Everybody loves Brontosaurus.
Let’s move along a few more years. Palaeontologists, who, you must remember, also know the name of the otherwise forgotten Apatosaurus keep eyeing Brontosaurus suspiciously. 

“Ah-ha!” they conclude. “This is the same dinosaur!” 

It’s the death knell of the Brontosaurus we are so fond of. Enter funeral march of Brontosaurus here… dum dum dee dum, dum dee dum dee dum dee dum…
Faced with two names, one, Brontosaurus, of which is known by almost the entire world and another, Apatosaurus, which, for the most part, no one has ever heard of, you would think the only sensible solution would be to drop the unknown name and keep the known one. This would save schools and other educational institutions worldwide millions on books. This would prevent significant confusion amongst those who, having already been robbed of the smallest of the planets in our solar system (oh, Pluto, where art thou!), would not be further traumatised by the disappearance of the much-beloved dinosaur they had grown up with. This perfectly logical solution would have been too easy! Unfortunately, to resolve such a conflict and prevent archaeological fisticuffs, the first name stands, the second name is resigned to the bin. Sensible be damned! And so, unbeknownst to me, Apatosaurus had won, Brontosaurus had lost. However, the scientific institutions must have learnt from the highly publicised demotion of Pluto, which sparked protests, outright denials and social media groups. They kept it all out of the spotlight and gave the mightiest of my childhood dinosaurs to the nether realm of unexistence. 

After the traumatic loss of Brontosaurus, I pull myself together. Parenthood must go on!

A short google later, I know everything there is to know about Apatosaurus’ egg size, most likely dietary requirements and the adult size of 22 meters. The eggs and diet are straightforward. But, are the 22 meters from nose to tail on a diagonal or along the ground while the dinosaur is standing? Never mind, I think. What are a few metres here and there? The dissertation devolves from a PhD to Masters.
Now for T-Rex…

Tyrannosaurus Rex? Possibly, the most famous dinosaur of all time? Star of countless movies? Apparently, it’s one of the rarest dinosaurs to find, and there are no complete skeletons found as yet. The best the experts have is 90% of it. And, there have been no T-Rex eggs found, ever! Experts don’t want to even guesstimate the egg size… The best I could do after much fruitless googling, which started to make me googly-eyed, was one expert saying they suspected a T-Rex egg was somewhere between the size of a penguin egg and an ostrich egg; possibly closer to the penguin egg. 
I’ve only made an omelette with chicken eggs.  What size is a penguin egg? Undeterred! I google! It seems I completely underestimated the variety of penguins out there. There are 17 different species of penguins of varying sizes with, obviously, a variety of different sized eggs. My expert obviously cheated me in his T-Rex egg guesstimate. I googled ostrich eggs instead and shaved a bit off the length. My daughter will never know… The dissertation is now at Batchelor level.

Stegosaurus, thankfully, Stegosaurus was easy as! The palaeontologists had taken pity on me.

Now, how do you blow up a balloon and measure it with a tape measure simultaneously? You can’t. Instead, you have to enlist(erm…force) a nearby husband into your madcap scheme. My husband held and puffed while I watched and measured… Make what you will of that particular sentence…

Ready and waiting for paper-macheing, the T-Rex egg balloon had suffered a puncture. The King of the dinosaurs was a frazzled bit of rubber measuring less than a centimetre beside the proudly puffed Apatosaurus and Stegosaurus. We hastily found another balloon. Hubby puffed, I measured. 

Everything was ready! I explained the fun activity, and my daughter ran away to hide in her tent. Apparently, the paper-mache would make her messy, and she was wearing a pretty dress! No amount of cajoling would bring her out of the tent. Pretty dress, especially one which was pink and swished from side to side when she wiggled, trumped ‘fun activity’ in her opinion.

My husband paper-mached Stegosaurus and Apatosaurus, I paper-mached T-Rex. My husband and I found the exercise quite relaxing and therapeutic. 
It took a day for the paper-mached eggs to dry out and the pretty dress to be placed in the wash, and then the eggs were painted in their own unique colours. Apatosaurus got blue, T-Rex got brown, and Stegosaurus was declared to be green. Since the experts can’t even guess at the egg size, who are they to tell us no to the colours? 

Apparently, Apatosaurus eggs also have stickers on them. I wasn’t around 65 million years ago, so who am I to say they didn’t…
With dried paper-mache, we pop the inner balloons with gusto. Destruction of any object (as long as it isn’t a pretty dress) is always met with immediate enthusiasm… Should I be worried?

Each egg also hatched. My husband spontaneously initiated this unplanned event with a pair of scissors, which delighted our daughter. She then coaxed them out of their eggs and painted each one a plate of food. T-Rex got meat (red and brown paint swirls), Apatosaurus got tree branches (green paint swirls), Stegosaurus got plants and flowers (green paint swirls with pink blobs). 

My next plan was to go out somewhere more spacious than our apartment. A 22-metre Apatosaurus was never going to fit…

Unfortunately, fate chose otherwise. That very morning we dropped my son off at nursery, only for him to be sent home again within the hour. What we thought was a mosquito bite was the start of chickenpox, and we weren’t going anywhere for two weeks. We measured the slightly smaller T-Rex and Stegosaurus in the longest part of our home, the corridor. My husband held one end of the tape measure, and my daughter and I took the other. We tried to measure a Stegosaurus but unfortunately, whoever made our spiffy tape measure had not considered the need to measure dinosaurs. The tape measure wasn’t long enough. Undeterred, we tag-teamed the length and found Stegosaurus was about 12 daughters long while T-Rex was between 2 and 3 husbands tall.
