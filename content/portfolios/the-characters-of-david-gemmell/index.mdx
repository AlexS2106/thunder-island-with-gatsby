David Gemmell was a writer. 

He didn't make interwoven, highly intricate plots. He didn't take you on a detailed epic tour of the world he created. He didn't wow you with artistic linguistics requiring a dictionary to be at hand. Usually, he didn't even write long books.

David Gemmell was a great writer.

He does sit us around an imaginary campfire with imaginary sausages at the end of imaginary sticks. He does put fictional blankets over our imaginary knees to keep us warm beneath a mythical starry night. He does let us imagine leaning in close to those flickering flames, huddling together against the darkest of fantastical nights as he tells us a story.

David Gemmell was a fantasy writer. 

He typically wrote high fantasy, focusing on heroic fantasy, swords and sorcery. He tended towards minimal sorcery but many swords, although one got an axe and another got a bow. Everybody gets some kind of a weapon anyway, but most don't get the sorcery. 

David Gemmell was a great fantasy writer.
The action just keeps the pages turning. There are no boring parts to a David Gemmell book. Like… none… 

David Gemmell's characters have character.

His characters don't just progress the plot. His characters have conversations, their personalities have flaws, and they make mistakes. They have moral dilemmas and moments of weakness. Sometimes they can be ugly or simple and have personality issues or illnesses. His books have no squeaky clean, sparkly souled, handsome heroes. There might be one, but his other personality is an ugly psychotic maniac, so I don't think he counts. Check out Dark Moon for that character and decide for yourself. 

As critics have opined, Gemmell's heroes are indeed all quite macho. But, his characters live in a harsh world derived from ancient Celtic culture and mythology. This wasn't an era where people would call off the battle because they didn't want to miss poetry hour. His male characters are often swinging weapons around and killing people. What appeals to me is that the females in his stories aren't any less lethal than their male counterparts – sometimes, they are more so. This balances things out nicely and is incredibly satisfying from a female perspective. Ok, ok, also, I admit it! I like a mostly good but not squeaky clean macho man for my main hero. It is fantasy, after all.

Of all the books, my favourite characters are those in Winter Warriors. They are old men at the end of their years, yet no less heroic. 

My husband likes Skilgannon the Damned – the guy has two swords, which is always better than just one! 

My friend likes Druss – he carries a big axe and likes to punch people.

If you like fantasy and want to just read a *damn good story* then read a David Gemmell book. You won't be disappointed. 

Someone said, "Happiness is finding a great author and discovering they wrote 12 more books." 

David Gemmell wrote 30 – what joy is this!
