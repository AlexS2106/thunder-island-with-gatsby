excerpt: An opinionated opinion on the epic high fantasy series of The Wheel Of Time by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson and the subsequent tv series.

The Wheel of Time Series should be read at least once!

I remember picking up the first book in this series at an airport while waiting to board a plane to Aruba. I had just gotten married the day before and was ready and waiting to embark on a wonderous two weeks of sun, sea and sand, aka the honeymoon. Like so many other travellers with not much else to do while waiting for a plane, I had a choice. Drink or shop. As alcohol causes havoc with my digestive system, I chose to shop. Happy as a kid in a candy shop, I was book shopping. I was book shopping because what else does one do on one’s honeymoon but read a good book? The book lovers everywhere are nodding right here. 

The Eye Of The World, or Book One of The Wheel of Time, stood out because it was the thickest book in the shop and in the fantasy genre, i.e. ‘practically perfect in every way!’ 

With the cobalt blue of the Caribbean before me, a brand new wedding ring on my finger and my husband, previously known as ‘the bf’ or ‘the other half’, happily perched on a stool at the beach bar experiencing the ‘drink-of-the-day’ I sat upon the white sands in my uplifting, super-slimming bikini and proceeded to speed-read through the whole book. By the end, I was a Wheel Of Time fan. I immediately set about denying the beach bar of an enthusiastic customer by means of passing the book along to my husband, and, a short time later, Robert Jordan had another fan of his book series. 
By the time ‘A Memory Of Light’, or Book 14 of the Wheel of the Time, or the very last book in the series, came out, my new husband was no longer new, and bikinis had been exchanged for swimsuits with maximum coverage - we had celebrated our tenth wedding anniversary.


### Books, books and more books!

Before I go further, I am going to summarise 14 huge books into one sentence and not give away any spoilers. Here goes…  A young farmboy goes forth into an inevitable battle with Shaiitan, the universe’s greatest evil, which threatens all worlds and times on a semi-regular basis. Ta-da!  Now we all know what we are talking about, let’s continue.

Many worldwide consider the wheel of time to be one of the most outstanding fantasy series of all time. It’s an epic high fantasy series that will keep you occupied for a very, very, very long time. It has two of the biggest names in fantasy writing it. This, due to the unfortunate passing of the incredibly imaginative creator and author, Robert Jordan. He finished book 11 but, realising his time was near, he made detailed notes for another author to complete his life’s work. His widow asked a then up and coming author, Brandon Sanderson, to complete the series using Jordan’s notes. Sanderson (now no longer up and coming but a shining star of an author in his own right) did an excellent job completing books 12, 13 and 14.

Now, do I think The Wheel Of Time is the best high fantasy series? Possibly. Up there at the top of the epic fantasy charts holding its own? Definitely! 14 books and ten years says yes! 

Truthfully, however, it does have a few flaws. There is nothing perfect, not even The Wheel Of Time. 

First, let’s tackle what I considered the most frustrating one. The array of characters. There are thousands of them – seriously! They often have very similar-sounding names. Let’s also add that some characters come back from the dead with a name change and a sex change. Confusing? Oh, yes! A few enormous books into the series and trying to remember who’s who is bewildering. There were numerous times when I would frustratingly attempt to trace a name back through the books to figure out who they were, resulting in a few epic and not so high fantasy swear word moments when I failed. 

The second, possibly similar issue, is that small events, long forgotten, come up in later books, making for numerous 'Eh? What did I miss?' moments as well.
There are a couple of other minor points which I believe are not flaws exactly but rather personal preferences of mine as a reader. For one, I considered the main hero to be one of the least interesting characters, but don’t let this opinion put you off reading. There is a large central core of characters, and this small detail is not as crucial as it might seem. And it wasn’t so much that he was boring, he wasn’t, but the others were a tad more interesting in comparison.  

My second point was that the romantic in me was left a little unsatisfied. I would have liked a few more pages dedicated to romantic writing. Jordan does not omit the romance, and his characters do fall in love; however, they seem to skip from the beginning of their romance to the end.  They lack a satisfying, exciting middle part to justify their attraction and make those little heart flutterings of anticipation I love to feel when reading.
So, what’s great about it? Oh! So many, many things. Too much to include and so I’ll pick a few. Jordan obviously put a humongous amount of thought into each character. All the characters, the great, the small and the in-between, have had their looks, personalities, emotional reactions, quirks and traits so well thought out that you’ll get to know them better than your own family. 
Jordan’s world-building has such incredible detail it surpasses that of J.R.R. Tolkien’s middle earth. Oooh! Nevah! You say! Yes, I’m afraid it, unfortunately, is so. There is more world to the world of The Wheel of Time than earth in middle-earth.  

When it comes to the story, Jordan weaves plots within plots within plots within plots … try to imagine plots within plots a few hundred more times before… within THE plot. There’s always a ton of things happening, so much so that there is not a chance you will ever be bored. Frazzled and confused, yes, bored, no.

Lastly, with its length, this series provides bang for your buck. You’ll be entertained and reading for a very long time.

### It's a TV series!

Whoop! Since I wrote this book review, a tv series has begun. A brand spanking new The Wheel Of Time tv-series. And, a few episodes in, I am thoroughly enjoying it. Although, I must point out that I have a few grumbles. Of course, I do!  

To read on is to be exposed to some spoilers. Continue at your own risk!
First, to understand my main grumble properly, it’s necessary to look back over Hollywood’s history with fantasy films. Let’s marvel at the Hollywood execs’ ability to see, read, and buy highly successful fantasy books before completely changing them to be almost unrecognisable. To then, make the resulting sad little disjointed story into a flop of a film everyone hates before sitting in their offices with teary eyes and a lack of profits, wondering where it all went wrong. That is until Game of Thrones came along. Bursting onto the tv screen, it was discovered that if you stick with the original story of a successful fantasy book, you will have a successful tv series. Well, who would have known that was the key to success… like doh! Follow this up with a few more, and suddenly the fantasy genre has become more fairly represented on the big and small screen and, it’s actually got those great original storylines too.  With such strides forward for decent fantasy viewing, I fully expected the Wheel of Time story to be left equally as pure. Unfortunately, this has not been so. Ahh!!!!

My first gripe shall begin at the beginning of the first episode when one of the female characters, Egwene, passes through some odd rites of womanly passage. Since Jordan ordained this womanly moment be marked by the permission to braid one’s hair Two Rivers style, this bizarre water moment is more suited to a particular sea cult in the Game of Thrones than an innocent farming community. And, as a point of fact, Egwene never actually reached this matronly moment in the books. Indeed, it was the source of a subplot sometime later, which added to the character’s development. In one tiny scene, two areas of the books have been inexorably altered already. 

Egwene and a male character, Rand, then indulge in sexual activities. As Jordan left out any sort of titillation until later, we don’t see this sort of thing until quite a few books later. So, why? The reason eludes me as it failed to add anything to the story. Now, while for Egwene, this fleshy indulgence is not such a problem, the innocence Rand has towards women is a part of his character. It plays a massive role in developing his relationships with other women later in the series and his treatment of women in general. They should have left it be. Naughty producer, director, writer or whoever!   
The casting for the Two Rivers folk also got diversified for no particular reason and is entirely at odds with all the laws of DNA. The Two Rivers folk had been happily inbreeding for generations; hence they all had brown hair and brown eyes. Only Nynaeve and Rand were different, and they stood out because they were different. Since Jordan himself diversified his imaginary world beyond the scope of our own, it seems a rather ridiculous thing to do. 

Another gripe, quite a big one this time, is when another character is given a spouse. One of the main points at the beginning is that the main characters are all young and carefree until a horde of Trollocs descends upon them one night. This spouse seemed to serve no purpose other than to irritate Jordan’s fans. There are thousands of characters in the books; why-oh-why have this one? Especially with less than a sentence spoken, she is summarily killed off, also, for no particular reason. 

Now for my biggest gripe, it’s big, huge! There is a part in the first book when Tam al’Thor is injured and delirious. Secrets are spilt, important secrets, hugely important secrets. In the tv series, this is missing.  What happened? Didn’t they read past the first book? Did they decide not to bother? Did it hit the cutting room floor by accident? It’s a major part of the story. It’s essential. It’s an ‘oh crap, how on earth can they fix this later’ moment.
A mini-gripe is the swearing, an unnecessary part of language made popular in television since Spartacus. Each series seems to be trying to outdo the last. I don’t believe I am the only person who feels it is unnecessary to swear my way through every uttered sentence. While currently, the swearing is very, very mild, we simply don’t need it. How about ditching it entirely? Jordan developed his own world-appropriate sweating. How about we use that instead?
My last gripe is for al’Lan Mandragoran. Now, I happen to like David Henney, the actor who plays him. (I was a long-time fan of Criminal Minds, so Henney will always be near and dear to my heart.) And, I have always had quite the thing for the character of Lan. But, the two combined are not quite right for me. I envisioned Lan to be of Mongolian descent for more than a decade while someone in casting decided on a Korean look. This results in a bit of a brain clash every time he is on screen, although, in truth, this one might be my bad. What is not my bad is the alteration to Lan’s character. Lan is moody and dark. He is stoic and serious. He is a little unfriendly, in all honesty. He also kicks ass! He is one of the best warders ever! The Lan on screen is far too willing to be friendly, chatty and show emotions… quite regularly… in front of people! In front of anybody and everybody! All this while allowing Moiraine to get badly hurt in every episode. This is definitely not in any way Lan-like at all!

Other minor character grumbles, whispered grumbles this time, are Loial. He doesn’t seem tall enough for an ogier, even a young one. Moiraine, on the other hand, is a bit too tall. I had always imagined Siuan as Hispanic-looking, but like the Lan situation, that might just be me. Moiraine and Siuan having a secret affair? Now, this one I’m a bit umm-ahh over. They have been in secret cahoots for years, so why not an affair too? And, as another fan mentioned, Jordan did describe the two of them as novice 'bed-fellows' along with all this implies. However, later in the books, this may cause problems for the direction of Siuan’s character. Again, an unnecessary scene could possibly wipe out yet another subplot. Although, it might well add depth to other subplots in exchange, so I shall grumble a little less on and wait and see…

Now, as for why I am enjoying it. The scenery is excellent, and the magic being cast looks fantastic! The fight choreography between the Aes Sedai and their warders is genius. The baddies look amazingly scary – like wow! Shadar Logoth was incredible; I wish they had shown a bit more of it.

Personally, I believe the wardrobe department made a mess of the stole of the Amyrlin Seat but made awesome costumes for the rest of the cast. I particularly liked how the Aes Sedai ‘dresses’ were still Aes Sedai dress-like but suitable for rough travelling. 

Rosamund Pike, despite being a little too tall for the character of Moiraine, okay, not really her fault, reigns supreme! Alanna, Liandrin and Leane are almost perfect for the characters. I especially like Alanna; my personal opinion is that Priyanka Bose has the character down wonderfully.

Despite my disappointment at the story alterations, I am enjoying it enough to remain excited until the next episode. I love it! It’s great! But, please, please, director, producer, writer, whoever is our ‘Amyrlin Seat’ of the series, don’t ruin it! Stick closer to the original story! After all, it’s what gained Robert Jordan so many fans, and it’s what we, the fans, all want to see!
