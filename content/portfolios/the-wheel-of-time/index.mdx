The Wheel of Time Series should be read at least once!

I remember picking up the first book in this series in an airport while waiting to board a plane to Aruba. I had just gotten married the day before and was ready and waiting to embark on a wonderful two weeks of sun, sea and sand, aka my honeymoon. Like many travellers with little to do while waiting for a plane, I had three choices: drink, eat or shop. As alcohol causes havoc with my digestive system and eating might result in my not fitting into my newly acquired bikini, I chose to shop. Happy as a kid in a candy shop, I went book shopping. What else does one do on one's honeymoon but read a good book? (Book lovers everywhere are nodding right here.) 

The Eye Of The World, or Book One of The Wheel of Time, stood out because it was the thickest book in the shop in the fantasy genre. Sometimes, with an eight-hour flight ahead, size does matter.

The next day, I had the cobalt blue of the Caribbean before me, a brand new wedding ring on my finger and my husband, previously known as 'the bf' or 'the other half', happily perched on a stool at the beach bar experiencing the 'drink-of-the-day'. I sat on the white sands in my uplifting, super-slimming bikini and proceeded to speed-read the whole book. It took most of the first week, and I was a Wheel Of Time fan by the end. 

I immediately set about denying the beach bar of an enthusiastic customer by passing the book along to my husband. By the end of the honeymoon, Robert Jordan had another fan of his book series.
 
When 'A Memory Of Light', this is Book 14 of the Wheel of the Time, and the very last book in the series, came out, my new husband, while still my husband, was no longer new, my bikinis had been exchanged for swimsuits with maximum coverage, and we had celebrated our tenth wedding anniversary.

### Books, books and more books!

Before I go further, I will summarise 14 huge books into one sentence and not give away any spoilers. Here goes…  A young farmboy goes forth into an inevitable battle with Shaiitan, the universe's greatest evil, which threatens all worlds and times on a semi-regular basis. Ta-da! Now we all know what we are talking about, let's continue.

Many people consider the wheel of time one of the most outstanding fantasy series in the genre. It's an epic high fantasy series that will keep you occupied for a very, very, very long time. 

It was the life's work of the author Robert Jordan who unfortunately was unable to finish it before his demise. After completing book 11, he made detailed notes for another author to complete his life's work. His widow asked a then up-and-coming author, Brandon Sanderson, who is now a fantasy genre heavyweight in his own right, to complete the series using Jordan's notes. Sanderson did an excellent job completing books 12, 13 and 14.

Do I think The Wheel Of Time is the best high fantasy series? Possibly. Up there at the top of the epic fantasy charts holding its own? Definitely! 14 books and ten years say yes! 

Truthfully, however, it does have a few flaws. There is nothing perfect, not even The Wheel Of Time. 

First, let's tackle what I considered the most frustrating one. The array of characters. There are thousands of them – seriously! They often have very similar-sounding names. Let's also add that some characters come back from the dead with a name change and a sex change. Confusing? Oh, yes! A few enormous books into the series and trying to remember who's who is bewildering. Numerous times, I would frustratingly attempt to trace a name back through the books to figure out who they were - this resulted in a few epic and not-so-high fantasy swear word moments when I failed. 

The second, possibly similar issue, is that small events, long forgotten, come up in later books, making for numerous 'Eh? What did I miss?' moments as well.

There are a couple of other minor points which I believe are not flaws exactly but rather personal preferences of mine as a reader. For one, I considered the main hero one of the least interesting characters. However, there is a large central core of characters, so this minor problem is not as crucial as it might seem. And it wasn't so much that he was boring, he wasn't, but the others were more interesting in comparison.  

My second point was that the romantic in me was left a little unsatisfied. I would have liked a few more pages dedicated to romantic writing. Jordan doesn't omit the romance, and his characters do fall in love; however, they seem to skip from the beginning of their romance to the end. They lack a satisfying, exciting middle part to justify their attraction and make those little heart flutterings of anticipation I love to feel when reading.

So now, what's great about it? Oh! So many, many things. Too much to include and so I'll pick a few.
 
Jordan obviously put a humongous amount of thought into each character. All the characters, the great, the small and the in-between, have had their looks, personalities, emotional reactions, quirks and traits so well thought out that you'll get to know them better than your own family. 

Jordan's world-building has such incredible detail it surpasses that of J.R.R. Tolkien's middle earth. Oooh! Nevah! You say! Yes, I'm afraid that, unfortunately, it is so. There is more world to the world of The Wheel of Time than earth in middle-earth.  

When it comes to the story, Jordan weaves plots within plots within plots within plots. Try to imagine plots within plots a few hundred more times before placing them all within **the** plot. There's always a ton of things happening, so much so that there isn't much chance you will ever be bored. Frazzled and confused, yes, bored, no.

Lastly, with its length, this series provides bang for your buck. You'll be entertained and reading for a very long time.
