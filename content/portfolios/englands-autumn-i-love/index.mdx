<PoemBody>

> In England, Autumn is a season to be loved, and I love. 
>
> It's the time of squirrels and the burying of nuts in the ground.
>
> It's a time of trees and their boughs that creak with the weight of Summers passed.
>
> It's the time of leaves on the ground and rustling blankets to hide all passages that crunch with a mysterious sound. 
>
> It's the time of invisible creatures and paw steps that echo, a presence betrayed at last. 
>
> It's the time that hails the darkness to come and the season that passes as the cold of Winter comes around.
