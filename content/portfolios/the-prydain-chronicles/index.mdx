My first encounter with the Welsh fantasy world of Prydain was a long time ago. In fact, I credit this series with my first step into reading fantasy and hold it solely responsible for the path of life-long love towards the genre. I loved these books, and I still do. The original books are still with me, battered and bruised more than thirty years later. They sit on my shelf beside The Wheel Of Time, the little brother and the big brother of fantasy.  
In truth, these books are children’s books, but then so is Harry Potter, and, let’s admit it, that didn’t stop any of us from a good read! So, let’s put this aside and lose ourselves in one of the best fantasy worlds I have ever been emersed in.
The Prydain Chronicles are a coming of age story and follows the life of a young boy called Taran. We meet him first as he is anointed with the ignominious position of assistant pig-keeper despite his dreams of becoming a great hero. When Taran subsequently loses the pig, his efforts to retrieve her begin his first adventure told in The Book of Three.  The Book of Three introduces many of the main characters who recur throughout each subsequent book. Taran is our hero to be. Dallben, Prydain’s greatest enchanter. Coll, the Pig-Keeper and a secret hero. Gwydion, a true hero but nothing like Taran had imagined a hero should be. Eilonwy, a very talkative princess. Fflewddur Fflam, a not-so-talented bard, and an always hungry creature called Gurgi. Other equally unique characters come and go. Over the next four books, Taran grows up into a hero himself and realises heroism is not all it is cracked up to be. 
While much of the story, subplots and characters are adapted from Welsh mythology, Lloyd Alexander has unleashed his imagination to write these books. I put Prydain on a par with Tolkien’s Middle-earth or Jordan’s The Wheel Of Time, and the depth of the characters matches that of David Gemmell. Perhaps, it is the coming of age concept that anchors this series within the children’s book category. 
The Prydain Chronicles is a lovely story, and the characters are wonderful. Reading about Taran, the assistant pig-keeper, will free your inner child. Hello, little you!
