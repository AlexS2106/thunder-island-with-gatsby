## Hi!

![Alex](/alex-profile-portrait-left.png "the author")

My name is Alex. It's short for Alexandra, which is far too long a name for day-to-day life. 

I was lucky enough to be born and bred in the striking Yorkshire countryside. But, after a few years of roaming around England, I, along with my husband, packed everything up and moved to Malta. As the years passed, we gained two great kids and an energetic dog, and 15 years later, we are still here.

A few years ago, I began a website to share my paleo recipes with the world. Since then, I have learned and grown, and the website has undergone many amorphous changes. Each alteration in design, coding, intent, and content acknowledges a new skill learned, usually from scratch, and a great way to practice it! 

Now named Thunder Island, this website keeps my hobbies and interests in one place.

I dabble in UI/UX design and practice new coding skills. I indulge in different writing styles with anecdotes, poems, and stories or tell the world about ex-pat life in Malta, along with a few scenic photos. I still share my recipes from the various diets my husband and I have been on and the recipes from when we weren't. - They were too delicious not to share! 

Most recently, I've been learning typescript and crocheting - neither skill is yet ready to be inflicted upon anyone but myself, but watch this space.

**All the best!**
