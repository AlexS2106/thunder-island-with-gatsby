## Hi!

![Alex](/alex-profile-portrait-left.png "the author")

My name is Alex. It's short for Alexandra, which is far too long a name for day to day life. 

I was lucky enough to be born and bred in Yorkshire. But, after a few years of roaming around England, I, along with my husband, packed everything up and moved to Malta. As the years passed, we had two great kids, and 15 years later, we are still here.

A few years ago, I began this website to share my, primarily, paleo recipes with the world. Since then, it has undergone many amorphous changes in design, coding, intent, and content. 

For now, it keeps my hobbies and interests in one place, lets me dabble in UI/UX design and allows me to practice my javascript coding skills and content writing as much as I like while providing a source of information and entertainment to others.  

**All the best!**
