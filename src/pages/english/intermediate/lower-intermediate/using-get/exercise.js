          <p>When my son got(1) his degree, I was so happy because I knew he had worked so hard for these last three years to get(2) it.</p>
          <p>I had saved up all the money I could and got(3) him a brand new car as a graduation present. All he had to do was go and get(4) it from the car shop. You should’ve seen his face when he got(5) it. He was so happy! </p>
          <p>He decided to take a year off then and drive around Europe in his new car. I was a bit worried, I have to be honest with you, but he’s a sensible boy. He got(6) his cleverness from me, so he did, so I knew he would be all right but still, a mother worries! </p>
          <p>He drove South to the seaport and got(7) the boat across to France. He spent the next two months travelling around the continent. Every week I got(8) a postcard from him from a different place. He was having such a great time! </p>
          <p>Eventually, I got a phone call. It was him! He told me he was in Italy. He said he’d got(9) himself an Italian girlfriend and been offered a job at an some firm in Italy. He had signed the contract already, and the company’s got(10) him now for a whole year. I was so happy but sad as well! I miss him, you see? Well, in the end, he asked me if I had got (11) a parcel from him yet. Well, I hadn’t. Obviously! So I said no. </p>
          <p>  ‘Well, Mum, get(12) yourself to the post office and go get (13) it.’ He said. And that’s why I’m here. Can I get (14) my parcel?</p>
